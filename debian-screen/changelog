  * Upload to unstable as the two RC issues which the experimental package
    had, are now resolved or at least workarounded:
    - Copy /usr/bin/screen to /tmp/screen-4.0.3 on upgrade from pre-4.1.0
      and use debconf to inform the user about it. (Closes: #644788)
    - Add patch to fix terminal handling on kfreebsd (Closes: #660567)
      Thanks Jan Christoph Nordholz!
  * Add patch to fix parallel building.
  * Use dh_lintian instead of handling lintian overrides manually.
  * No more clean up manually what dh_clean can clean up.

    - Lintian warning manpage-has-errors-from-man fixed by replacing all
      occurrences of "..." by "…"
    - Fixes tons of lintian warnings hyphen-used-as-minus-sign

      upstream.
    - Manually adapted patch 26source_encoding.

  * Add "defnonblock 5" to the default screenrc which ought to improve

    a patch by Nico Golde. Thanks! Closes: #308818.
  * Add a kluge to prevent screen from locking up when doing strange things
    with xon and flow control enabled. Still waiting for upstream to properly
    fix this problem, so this only addresses: #157873.
  * Extend the documentation about the strange activation of the nethack
    feature. Closes: #205531.
  * Don't create /tmp/screen-exchange with default mode 0666. Closes: #433338.
  * Add a Q&A pair to README.Debian on how to enable the multiuser feature.
    The problem is mentioned in the manpage under '-r', too, so I consider this
    sufficiently documented now. Closes: #92036.
  * Fix the exitcode mess of '-q -ls' (and its combinations with -d, -r and -x)
    to keep the promises the manpage makes. Doing this on my own, no comment
    from upstream yet. Closes: #426328.
  * More documentation typo fixes.
  * Properly parse the long commandline options like '-wipe'. Don't accept
    as soon as it's unambiguous - this is not getopt(). Closes: #222023.
  * Increase the maximum length of the input buffer (C-a :). Closes: #379384.

  * Better warnings now than worries later: add -Wextra to CFLAGS
    (and counter with "-Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-missing-field-initializers"
    to get the noise back to an acceptable level).
  * Now that more warnings are visible, kill a few of them (new patch, ready
    to be submitted upstream: 16fix_gcc_warnings).
  * Drop Pre-Depends from debian/control (wasn't even used, so this is just
    cosmetical).
  * Clarify debian/copyright after consulting upstream. Closes: #403896.
  * Increase MAXSTR by a sufficient amount. The usage pattern of this macro
    doesn't justify a switch to dynamic allocation, so simply increasing it
    is fine with me. Closes: #271384.
  * Fix upstream #20277 by expanding SCREENENCODINGS twice during configure.
    Closes: #435340. Thanks Victor Hsieh!
  * Advise against using the "sessionname" command. The problem has been acked
    upstream, so there's nothing more I can do - besides, there are alternatives.
    Closes: #103771.
  * Fix the "C-a M" toggle command that was broken when combined with a setting
    of 'defmonitor on' in one's .screenrc. Closes: #310568.
  * Correct a manpage error (defining a limitation that actually doesn't exist).

  * Clean up the maintainer scripts:
    * Stop using debconf. Its only purpose was to display a warning message
      when upgrading from << 3.9.5-5, which was uploaded in the 20th century.
    * Drop debian/preinst completely.
    * Replace case constructions in the other scripts with if blocks.
    * Stop trying to remove /var/run/screens - I couldn't find any reference
      to that directory. Move remove-shell call to prerm. Closes: #374471.
    * Mute the init script. Closes: #385895.
    * Recreate /var/run/screen on install/reboot if necessary (e.g. tmpfs) with
      the appriopriate permissions (depending on the screen binary - some
      admins might choose to install it setuid using dpkg-statoverride).
      Closes: #357578, #390506, #397088.
  * Fix a couple of manpage typos. Closes: #414241, #417647.
  * Enhance the copyright message (add the GPL boilerplate, formatting fixups).
    Addresses #403896, but the year issue is still pending.
