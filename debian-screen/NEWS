screen (4.1.0~20120320gitdb59704-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Currently screen 4.1.0 cannot reattach to running screen instances
  started by screen 4.0.3 like the screen version from Debian Squeeze.

  If a running screen session was detected during upgrade, a copy of the
  old screen binary has been made at /tmp/screen-4.0.3. In most cases it's
  sufficient to call "/tmp/screen-4.0.3 -rd" to reattach to a session
  started before screen was upgraded to 4.1.0.

  In case your /tmp/ is mounted with one of the options nosuid or noexec,
  the above won't work. You need to copy the screen binary elsewhere
  instead. If only the root user needs it, /root/ is likely an appropriate
  place. If also normal users need to resurrect their running screen
  sessions, copy it to e.g. /usr/local/bin/: "cp -pv /tmp/screen-4.0.3
  /usr/local/bin/"

  Make sure, owner, group and permissions are preserved. Screen may argue
  about /var/run/screen/ having the wrong permissions if the group of the
  binary is not "utmp" and the permissions of the binary are not 2755
  (rwx-r-sr-x).

  In case the copy hasn't been made or failed, you can download the old
  package from a Debian mirror close to you. Check
  http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/screen/ for the latest screen
  binary package with 4.0.3 in the version number for your architecture.

  For most architectures this is
  http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/screen/screen_4.0.3-14_<your-architecture>.deb,
  e.g. for amd64 it is
  http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/screen/screen_4.0.3-14_amd64.deb

  Full HOWTO for copy and paste (to be used as root user):

    mkdir /root/old-screen/
    cd /root/old-screen/
    ARCH=`dpkg --print-architecture`
    wget http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/screen/screen_4.0.3-14_$ARCH.deb || \
      wget http://cdn.debian.net/debian/pool/main/s/screen/screen_4.0.3-14+b1_$ARCH.deb
    dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile screen_4.0.3-14*.deb | tar xvf - ./usr/bin/screen
    usr/bin/screen -rd
