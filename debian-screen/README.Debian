Debian Screen Q&A
-----------------

Q: screen always complains about the permissions of /var/run/screen.
   What's wrong?

A: Simplified, the binary ensures that $SCREENDIR has just enough permission
   bits enabled so that each user can create and access his socket directory.
   This means:

   /usr/bin/screen setuid root -> /var/run/screen 0755
   /usr/bin/screen setgid utmp -> /var/run/screen 0775
   /usr/bin/screen without setid bits -> /var/run/screen 0777

   These cases are all handled by the init script. However, the actual test
   is a bit more complicated. And as the variable names are all quite self-
   explanatory, just have a look at the C code itself:

]   n = (eff_uid == 0 && (real_uid || (st.st_mode & 0775) != 0775)) ? 0755 :
]       (eff_gid == (int)st.st_gid && eff_gid != real_gid) ? 0775 :
]       0777;
]   if (((int)st.st_mode & 0777) != n)
]     Panic(0, "Directory '%s' must have mode %03o.", SockDir, n);

   If the invoking user has primary group utmp, the above assumption will fail.
   The same holds if the underlying file system is mounted 'nosuid'. In these
   cases you have to adapt the init script yourself.


Q: shift+page up in xterm/gnome-terminal/konsole used to let me scroll back a
   bit, but now it doesn't. How can I make it work with scrollback?

A: It doesn't scrollback consistently because screen (the program) displays in
   xterm's alternate screen buffer.

   To have screen use xterm's normal screen buffer (which includes scrollback),
   you can add the following to your .screenrc:

   termcapinfo xterm|xterms|xs|rxvt ti@:te@


Q: Screen sets my xterm titlebar. I don't like this, how do I make it stop?

A: The titlebar setting is set in the /etc/screenrc by telling screen that some
   of the GUI terminals have a hardstatus line and that it can be set by
   sending the xterm escape sequences that set the title/icon.

   # Set the hardstatus prop on gui terms to set the titlebar/icon title
   termcapinfo xterm*|rxvt*|kterm*|Eterm* hs:ts=\E]0;:fs=\007:ds=\E]0;\007

   You can override this on a system wide basis by commenting out this line in
   the /etc/screenrc or you can override it in your personal screenrc by adding
   the following line:

   hardstatus alwaysmessage


Q: Why do I get #!$@#$@!% trailing spaces when I cut and paste from mutt
   running within screen?
Q: Why does the statusbar in my irc client extend to the end of the screen
   in xterm but not in screen?

A: This has to do with handling of the bce terminal attribute, or lack
   thereof by default in screen. You can enable bce on a per-user basis by
   adding the following to your .screenrc:

   defbce on
   term screen-bce

   NOTE: if you do this your TERM will be screen-bce. When you login to
         other machines they may not have a screen-bce terminal type, so you
         will see errors. To fix this you must put the terminfo for screen-bce
         on that remote machine. The screen terminfo is found in
         /usr/share/doc/screen/terminfo/screeninfo.src and you can compile it
         on the remote machine using tic(1).


Q: Screen doesn't notice when I resize the term - what's wrong?

A: Firstly look for the same question in FAQ.gz. If the problem persists:
   There have been reports of sshd instances blocking SIGWINCH (presumably
   restarted from aptitude and thus inheriting its signal mask) which therefore
   also prohibit remote screen sessions from ever seeing the signal. Have a
   look at the old bugreport <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=392302>
   for means to determine whether you are affected. (You might have to restart
   sshd with a crontab entry or similar magic if ssh is your only way to access
   the box.)


Q: Multiuser mode is not working - how can I enable it?

A: Screen has to be setuid root to accomplish this. (Note the security implications
   this has! Also bear in mind that setuid programs remove some variables from their
   environment for exactly this reason - see ld.so(1).) If you still want to enable
   the feature, you may do so with the following commands:

] dpkg-statoverride --update --add root utmp 4755 /usr/bin/screen
] chmod 0755 /var/run/screen

   dpkg-statoverride will make sure that the modified permissions remain in effect
   even if a new version of the screen package is installed. /var/run/screen will
   be automatically recreated with the proper permissions if the directory lives
   on volatile storage (doesn't persist between subsequent reboots).
