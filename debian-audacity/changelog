audacity (2.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.

  [ Petr Vorel ]
  * debian/watch: Check for xz compressed tarballs. (Closes: #722133)

  [ Sebastian Ramacher ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/bp-docdir-fix.patch: Removed (applied upstream).
  * Disable libav support. (Closes: #692809)
    audacity is not yet compatible with libav 9 and needs to be ported first.
    Until audacity has been ported, support for some audio formats (AC3, M4A,
    MP4, WMA) is not available.
    - debian/control: Remove libav{codec,format,util}-dev build dependencies.
    - debian/rules: Build with --without-ffmpeg.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to clean up generated auto* files.
  * Bump debhelper compat to 9.
    - Decreases the Installed-Size of audacity-dbg by a large amount since
      dh_strip now uses compressed debugging symbol files.
    - {C,CXX,LD,CPP}FLAGS are automatically exported.
    - Bump debhelper build dependency to >= 9. We at least need 8.1 to
      support Standards-Version 3.9.4 (binary-{arch,indep} targets).
  * debian/rules: Override dh_auto_clean since it gets confused by the output
    of 'make clean' and 'make distclean' and does not detect that the targets
    are available.
  * debian/control: Remove useless zip build-dependency.

audacity (1.3.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build against system FFmpeg for import and export support
    (Closes: #512278, #5143333).
  * Build-Depend on recent versions of the ffmpeg headers and recommend ffmpeg
    shared libraries with recent sonames to make sure the ffmpeg packages are
    new enough for audacity.
  * Recent ffmpeg packages have Speex support enabled, so audacity can also
    benefit from this feature (Closes: #329802).
  * Re-enable PortMixer, as recommended upstream:
