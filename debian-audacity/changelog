  [ Sebastian Ramacher ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/patches/bp-docdir-fix.patch: Removed (applied upstream).
  * Disable libav support. (Closes: #692809)
    audacity is not yet compatible with libav 9 and needs to be ported first.
    Until audacity has been ported, support for some audio formats (AC3, M4A,
    MP4, WMA) is not available.
    - debian/control: Remove libav{codec,format,util}-dev build dependencies.
    - debian/rules: Build with --without-ffmpeg.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to clean up generated auto* files.
  * Bump debhelper compat to 9.
    - Decreases the Installed-Size of audacity-dbg by a large amount since
      dh_strip now uses compressed debugging symbol files.
    - {C,CXX,LD,CPP}FLAGS are automatically exported.
    - Bump debhelper build dependency to >= 9. We at least need 8.1 to
      support Standards-Version 3.9.4 (binary-{arch,indep} targets).
  * debian/rules: Override dh_auto_clean since it gets confused by the output
    of 'make clean' and 'make distclean' and does not detect that the targets
    are available.
  * debian/control: Remove useless zip build-dependency.

audacity (1.1.99pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 'zip' to Build-deps.  Previously zip was in non-US which required
    me to pre-zip the help file before uploading, but this is no longer
    the case.  (closes: #226261)
  * The rebuild should resolve the runtime link warnings and crashes
    (closes: #227903)
  * Nyquist is no longer configured to be part of the build.  It
    prevents mips and mipsel from building correctly, and no one
    is prepared to fix the problems at this time.

audacity (1.1.99pre1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    works correctly
  * Changes to configure.in, such as recognizing when libsndfile is
    not present
  * Build-depend on libsndfile1-dev, so autobuilders won't fail
    (closes: #204334)

audacity (1.1.99pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream 1.2 prerelease.  Far too many new features to list.
  * Audacity 1.2 does not support opening MIDI files, so the
    Open Midi -> Export Ogg crash is no longer triggerable (closes: #150654)
  * Audacity 1.2 performs checks to guard against multiple instances
    running concurrently, to prevent multiple instances from interfering
    with each others temporary files.  (closes: #182782)
  * We now use libsndfile for sound file i/o, so 8 bit files should
    no longer be distorted.  (closes: #187304)
  * Recompile should fix weird, unexplainable, unreproducable runtime
    linking error. (closes: #187504)
  * Audacity 1.2 has a completely new audio i/o backend.  The code that
    caused a problem when changing devices in the preferences has been
    completely rewritten.  (closes: #188808)
  * We no longer link against id3lib (thank goodness) so the FTBFS that
    was clearly caused by id3lib should no longer be an issue.
    (closes: #192328)
  * "<" and ">" removed from URL display to prevent the URL from disappearing
    entirely from the packages.d.o web pages that don't properly escape them.

  * The recompile should also solve problems with the dynamic linker
    not finding the correct libstdc++.  (closes: #184905)

audacity (0.98-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * New build-depends on libwxgtk2.2-dev (>=2.2.9.2) should solve any
    remaining libpng problems.  This will effectively revert us back to
    libpng2, since this is what the libwxgtk2.2 maintainer decided on.

 -- Joshua Haberman <joshua@debian.org>  Wed,  6 Mar 2002 20:12:42 -0800

audacity (0.98-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Full upstream release.
  * All effects will correctly cancel now. (closes: #129381)
  * Fixed subtle but serious bug in libmad mp3 importing code that would
    randomly cause freezes when importing mp3s. (closes: #129380)
  * Build-depends on wxWindows and libpng are versioned to force libpng3
    for both. (closes: #128463)

 -- Joshua Haberman <joshua@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jan 2002 23:51:20 -0800

audacity (0.97.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminated build-dependency on 'zip' by pre-zipping the help file. I was
    previously unaware that zip is in non-us, making the build-dep a policy
    violation. Unfortunately, this required a new source tarball, since
    Debian diffs don't seem to allow binary files.

 -- Joshua Haberman <joshua@debian.org>  Tue,  1 Jan 2002 22:47:26 -0800

audacity (0.97.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream prerelease. Upstream we have fixed many important bugs, but
    the next full release may not be ready for Debian's freeze. These
    fixes should definitely go in woody.
  * Audacity no longer includes its own complete copy of libmpeg3 and
    id3lib; instead we link against the debian packages libmad0-dev and
    libid3-dev. This effectively sidesteps the problems of id3lib
    building (or not building) on 64 bit architectures.
    (closes: #121599, #123132, #126769)
  * improved debian/rules to more completely "make clean." (closes: #126761)
