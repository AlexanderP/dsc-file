 This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution
 .
 The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
 non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
 whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
 (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)
 .
 This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
 Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
 file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
 version without encryption capabilities).
 .
 If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
 NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.
 .
 This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".
 .
 The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
 http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
 Encryption is not supported.
