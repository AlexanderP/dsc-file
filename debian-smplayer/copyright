 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose, including
 commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it freely, subject to
 the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

 Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries) must
 reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list of
 conditions in documentation and/or other materials provided with the
 distribution. Additional documentation is not needed for executables where a
 command line license option provides these and a note regarding this option is
 in the executable's startup banner. The sole exception to this condition is
 redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as part of a
 self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this license, as
 long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from the binary or disabled.
 .
 Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating systems,
 existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with modified or added
 functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library versions not from
 Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not be misrepresented as being
 the original source or, if binaries, compiled from the original source. Such
 altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP
 releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the altered versions with
 the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to,
 different capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
 explicit permission of Info-ZIP. Such altered versions are further prohibited
 from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or the
 Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP will provide support for the altered
 versions.
 .
 Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
 "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its own source
 and binary releases.
