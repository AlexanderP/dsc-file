blender (2.53-beta-svn30596-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [Kevin Roy]
    * New Upstream Beta Release.
    * New Maintainer (Closes: #570053).
    * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1
    * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format.
    * debian/patches
      - Update patches from contrib sources (see below)
      - Use gbp-pq to produce patch series
      - mini fix to make blender look for system dir in /usr/lib
    * Add get-orig-source in debian/rules
       - A rule to ease download orig.tar.gz from upstream svn
    * Modify install of blender-thumbnailer.py:
       - This script is now in /usr/lib/blender/2.53/scripts.
       - Although it may be run with python 2.5.
         For consistency with dependencies, make it run with 3.1
       - Add quoted infos from the script to enabled it.
       - As it's nautilus related, maybe worth packaging it alone.
    * Introduce doc-base for readme.html.
    * Transform some dh_auto_install commands into patches
       - 50_filter_docs : copy "allowed" files 
         (this means don't install the GPL and Python licenses).
       - 60_locale_directory : change locale destination to /usr/share/locale 
         and not /usr/lib/blender/2.53/locale.
    * Update icons with those shipped in upstream source.
    * Remove fullscreen entry in menu because it can be enabled in Blender now

  [Cosme Domínguez Díaz]
    * debian/patches
      - Remove unneeded 'build_configuration' patch
      - Modify 'install_in_usr_lib' for easier maintain of 
        blender_thumbnailer patch
    * debian/control
      - Remove quilt (Build-Depends)
    * debian/copyright
      - No longer mention extern/{ffmpeg,libmp3lame,xvidcore,x264}
        as no longer in upstream.
    * debian/rules
      - Enable cmake build options
      - Detect and use multi processor (if any)
    * debian/blender.1
      - Remove manpage from debian directory as upstream shipped
        one more updated

    * debian/patches
      - FTBFS fix for KFreeBSD

 -- Kevin Roy <kiniou@gmail.com>  Sun, 22 Aug 2010 13:04:22 +0200

blender (2.50~alpha~0~svn24834-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add debug package blender-dbg:
     - Introduce $(INSTDIR) in debian/rules, set it to debian/tmp instead
       of previously-used debian/blender since there are now several
       binary packages.
     - Introduce debian/blender.install.
     - Override dh_strip to put debug symbols in blender-dbg.
     - Override dh_install to make sure nothing gets forgotten and
       installed nowhere.
  * Fix menus by shipping miscellaneous files from debian/misc/, thanks to
    Stefano Costa (Closes: #563799):
     - Ship menu icon (blender.xpm).
     - Ship freedesktop menus (*.desktop).
  * Bump version for debhelper in Build-Depends from 7 to 7.0.50~ since
    overrides are used.
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.8.3 to 3.8.4 (no changes needed).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Feb 2010 02:55:48 +0100

blender (2.50~alpha~0~svn24834-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot:
     - Use the blender-2.50-release tag, svn revision 24834.
     - Upstream codename is 2.5 alpha 0.
     - “Repack” as documented in debian/copyright.
  * Drop all patches for now.
  * Great cleanup / Switch from debhelper 5 to dh 7:
     - Bump versioned Build-Depends on debhelper.
     - Bump debian/compat.
     - Get rid of the current debian/rules, start over with a tiny one,
       only using the quilt addon, and the cmake buildsystem. Given there
       are at least scons and cmake files, let's give a hint to dh.
     - Get rid of debian/{install,links}: no longer needed.
     - Get rid of lintian overrides: no longer needed.
     - Get rid of the wrapper: hopefully no longer needed.
  * Add patches:
     - 10_build_configuration: configure the build for Debian using the
       top-level CMakeLists.txt file. Currently, it enables the following
       items: ffmpeg, openjpeg, fftw3, jack, sndfile.
     - 20_install_in_usr_lib: arch-dep files have to go to /usr/lib, they
       don't belong to /usr/share. Only needed if embedded python isn't
       removed from the final binary (see below), disabled for now.
     - 30_use_systemwide_libraries: Use system-wide glew and openjpeg
       libraries, and do not use -lstdc++ for linking.
  * Update Build-Depends:
     - Replace scons with cmake in Build-Depends.
     - Add libsndfile-dev, libjack-dev, libsamplerate0-dev, libfftw3-dev,
       and libglew1.5-dev.
     - Finally wrap them!
     - Drop unneeded libdc1394-22-dev.
  * Switch python version as needed upstream, from 2.5 to 3.1:
     - Update Build-Depends on pythonX.Y-dev.
     - Update debian/pyversions.
     - Unfortunately, python (>= 3.1) gets added to Depends, which makes
       the resulting binary uninstallable even in experimental.
     - Replace ${python:Version} with hardcoded python3.1 for now.
     - Disable dh_pysupport for now, there's no support for 3.* in
       python-support yet.
  * Get rid of embedded python by overriding dh_auto_install:
     - Blender should fall back to the system python if there's no
       embedded one.
  * Remove apparently-unneeded dotfiles:
     - At the moment, that's .bfont.ttf and .Blanguages.
     - Even when the latter is here, lang selection doesn't seem to work.
     - Here, “apparently” means “does not show up in strace”.
  * Adjust README.source to mention $VCS.
  * Remove README.Debian, quite obsolete.
  * Add a NEWS file.
  * Update debian/copyright:
     - No longer mention extern/bFTGL, no longer in SVN.
     - Add extern/glew.

blender (2.49.2~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
     - This is actually 2.49b, but using a “+dfsg” suffix breaks comparing
       2.49+dfsg and 2.49b+dfsg. Use “.2” instead of “b” accordingly. And
       switch to using a “~dfsg” suffix.
  * Repack as usual, as documented in debian/copyright.
  * Drop patch (merged upstream):
     - 30_fix_python_syntax_warning

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Nov 2009 17:08:04 +0100

blender (2.49+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update Build-Depends: replace libglut-dev with freeglut3-dev as the
    latter does no longer provide the former (Closes: #545622).
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.8.1 to 3.8.3 (no changes needed).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Sep 2009 19:31:29 +0200

blender (2.49+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Hopefully, since upstream upgraded their embedded copies of ffmpeg
    libraries (which we don't use), and adapted their code accordingly,
    troubles should go away, and at least sound seems to be working fine
    now (Closes: #519396). Thanks to Rebecca Breu for her help.
  * Update dependencies:
     - Add libavdevice-dev and libopenjpeg-dev to Build-Depends.
     - Add “libavdevice” to the “pkg-config --libs” call through the
       50_debian_build_config patch, and “-lopenjpeg” as well.
  * debian/copyright:
     - Update the list of removed directories: add extern/libopenjpeg.
  * Refresh patches:
     - 10_use_systemwide_ftgl
     - 50_debian_build_config
     - 70_portability_platform_detection
  * Drop patches (merged upstream):
     - 90_fix_ffmpeg_includes
     - 91_update_to_new_ffmpeg_api
  * Add patch:
     - 30_fix_python_syntax_warning: Fix Python 2.5/2.6 syntax warning
       during byte-compilation by using “except Foo, bar:” instead of
       “except Foo as bar:”.
  * debian/rules:
     - Get rid of CFLAGS handling, dpkg-buildpackage does that.
     - Get rid of dh_desktop, now a no-op.
  * debian/control:
     - Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes needed).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 01 Jun 2009 01:42:09 +0200

blender (2.48a+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable now that lenny is released (yay).
  * Introduce patch to fix ffmpeg header includes, fixing FTBFS with newer
    ffmpeg (Closes: #516962), and uninstallability (Closes: #518204):
     - 90_fix_ffmpeg_includes
  * Also try to use the new API: avcodec_decode_audio2() instead of
    avcodec_decode_audio(). But since the how-to-upgrade note is kind of
    cryptic to me, that's a temptative patch only, user reports are very
    welcome (a mail to myself would do), especially if the audio sequencer
    is well-tested! For that matter, introduce this patch:
     - 91_update_to_new_ffmpeg_api
  * Update the following patch to also link against libavcodec:
     - 50_debian_build_config
  * Thanks so much to ffmpeg folks for their advance warning and the patch
    in the BTS!
  * debian/control:
     - Add B-D on libvorbis-dev and libgsm1-dev: They were probably
       pulled indirectly previously, let's make the build dependencies
       explicit now.
  * Keep the urgency to “low” even though it's about fixing an RC bug,
    testing is needed.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Tue, 03 Mar 2009 02:53:51 +0000

blender (2.48a+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #503680).
  * Patches:
     - 01_sanitize_sys.path: Refresh accordingly.
     - 30_gameengine_libgl_location_fix: Drop, patched code went away.
     - 40_freetype_fix_miscall: Drop, patched code is now commented out.
     - 45_fix_python_syntax_warning: Drop, was a backport.
     - 50_debian_build_config: Refresh.
     - 60_various_workarounds: Drop, no longer needed.
  * No longer unpatch before cleaning (one never knows).
  * Tidy up debian/TODO.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Dec 2008 00:33:51 +0100

blender (2.46+dfsg-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add patch to fix FTBFS now that python's sys.platform reports
    linux2-$arch on various architectures (alpha, hppa, mips*, sparc), see
    #499132. At toplevel, the SConstruct script sets ENV['OURPLATFORM'] to
    sys.platform, and with this patch, makes it become 'linux2' when the
    platform string starts with 'linux2', and since userland is the same,
    ditto when the platform string starts with 'gnukfreebsd'. That patch
    also adds a check for sys.platform starting with those variables in
    various parts (which are not using ENV['OURPLATFORM]'), mostly in
    SConscript scripts, and in Python scripts shipped under the
    release/scripts directory (Closes: #503639):
     - debian/patches/70_portability_platform_detection
  * Keep urgency to “high” since the previous upload couldn't migrate to
    testing because of this FTBFS.
  * Enable GNU/kFreeBSD support again. The previous patch was obsolete,
    and this new one benefits from the aforementioned one, since there's
    no need to add a specific check for tests on ENV['OURPLATFORM']. Don't
    delete the (already disabled) 10_gnukfreebsd_support patch to keep the
    release team happy:
     - debian/patches/80_gnukfreebsd_support
  * Add documentation on how to upgrade to a new upstream release, which
    will mostly be useful to keep those patches uptodate:
     - debian/README.source

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 03 Nov 2008 00:52:01 +0100

blender (2.46+dfsg-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Include patch by James Vega (thanks!) to fix security bug: Blender's
    BPY_interface was calling PySys_SetArgv so that sys.path was prepended
    with an empty string, resulting in possible arbitrary code execution,
    when the working directory contains a file named like one that
    Blender's python scripts try to import (Closes: #503632). That patch
    removes empty elements from sys.path:
     - debian/patches/01_sanitize_sys.path
  * Urgency set to “high” accordingly.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Oct 2008 06:44:20 +0100

blender (2.46+dfsg-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix python syntax warning in import_dxf.py, which led to nasty output
    in installation/upgrade logs during byte-compilation, using a patch
    provided by the script author (Closes: #492280):
     - debian/patches/45_fix_python_syntax_warning

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Fri, 08 Aug 2008 02:45:40 +0200

blender (2.46+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix crash on “Add > Text” spotted by Antonio Ospite. Some additional
    checks were introduced in freetype 2.3.6, which now leads to a crash
    of Blender since the latter isn't using the appropriate function, and
    since a cast was added to bypass compiler warnings. It looks like when
    passing FT_ENCODING_UNICODE as second argument, one is interested in
    calling FT_Select_Charmap() rather than FT_Set_Charmap(). The
    following patch at least fixes the crash, although upstream hasn't
    commented on it yet (Closes: #487890):
     - debian/patches/40_freetype_fix_miscall
  * Add a Build-Depends on libdc1394-22-dev (only on Linux architectures),
    and move the “pkg-config --libs” call from libdc1394 to libdc1394-2
    (following the move from libdc1394-13 to libdc1394-22), so that the
    library is correctly found, and so that the blender binary is
    correctly linked (Closes: #490317). Update the following patch to this
    effect:
      - debian/patches/50_debian_build_config

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Mon, 14 Jul 2008 03:28:47 +0200

blender (2.46+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable. That also makes sure the package is installable
    again (Closes: #484709).
  * Refresh the following patch since FTGL's API finally got stable, and
    since using “foo().Xf()” is no longer needed. It now only contains the
    missing <GL/gl.h> include (Closes: #485953).
     - debian/patches/20_fix_ftbfs_with_latest_ftgl
  * Merge the following patch from Ubuntu, so that the appropriate symlink
    is used for libGL (libGL.so.1 rather than libGL.so, which is only
    available if the development package is installed). Patch by Lukas
    Fittl, forwarded by Daniel Hahler (Closes: #484440).
     - debian/patches/30_gameengine_libgl_location_fix
  * Improve debian/misc/*.desktop, thanks to Daniel Hahler again
    (Closes: #484439):
     - Add German translation.
     - Split Name into Name and GenericName.
     - Drop extension for Icon.
     - Fix syntax for MimeType.
  * Bump Standards-Version from 3.7.3 to 3.8.0 (no changes needed).
  * debian/watch:
     - Rewrite regex (equivalent but nicer).
     - Add version mangling (due to the repack).

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Jun 2008 09:02:28 +0200

blender (2.46+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #482034).
  * Repack to get rid of embedded code copies (extern/), in particular
    video encoders: bFTGL, ffmpeg, libmp3lame, xvidcore, x264.
  * debian/copyright:
     - Update accordingly.
  * debian/rules:
     - Update CONFIG_SCRIPTS accordingly (config.{guess,sub} removed).
  * debian/copyright:
     - Upstream now uses “pristine” GPL-2+ license statements, and no
       longer the dual GPL/BL license.
     - Update copyright years.
     - Specify the license for the Debian packaging too (GPL-2+).
     - Implement a version of the copyright format proposal.
  * debian/patches/02_tmp_in_HOME:
     - The context changed, modify it so that it finally checks for
       “/tmp/” before returning, and switch to using “$HOME/.blender/”
       instead in that case.
     - As a side note, it wouldn't be sufficient to set TMP or TMPDIR in
       the wrapper since the factory B.blend file contains that hardcoded
       value, and is used at the very beginning of the BLI_where_is_used()
       function.
     - That doesn't prevent files from being written in /tmp, but at least
       keeps quit.blend out of there, as that was already previously done.
  * debian/patches/04_de_po_fix:
     - Drop it, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/10_gnukfreebsd_support:
     - Disable it, needs update.
  * debian/patches/20_gcc4.3_support:
     - Drop it, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/30_fix_CVE-2008-1102:
     - Drop it, was backported from upstream.
  * debian/patches/40_workaround_scons_options_deprecation:
     - Drop it, merged upstream (in a slightly different way).
  * debian/patches/50_debian_build_config:
     - Drop 2nd hunk since WITH_BF_OPENAL now defaults to “false”.
     - Adapt the context of the (now) 5th hunk since BF_FFMPEG_LIB got
       moved some lines above, and is now empty (further tweaks might be
       needed).
     - Refresh (get rid of the offset for) the other hunks.
  * debian/patches/60_various_workarounds:
     - Add it, used to work around some C*FLAGS-related problem with
       scons.
  * Update ffmpeg support:
     - debian/control: Add libswscale-dev to Build-Depends.
     - debian/patches/50_debian_build_config: Add libswscale to the
       “pkg-config --libs” call.
  * Use the system-wide FTGL library instead of the embedded one, thanks
    Sam Hocevar (Closes: #478015):
     - debian/control: Replace ftgl-dev with libftgl-dev in Build-Depends
       since the former is deprecated (dummy package in oldlibs). Since
       the package name change happened when the FTGL shared library was
       introduced, that also ensures that no static FTGL library is used.
     - debian/patches/50_debian_build_config:
        - Use “/usr” for BF_FTGL instead of “#extern/bFTGL”.
        - Use “${BF_FTGL}/include/FTGL” for BF_FTGL_INC since
          “pkg-config --cflags ftgl” returns several “-I” flags.
        - Use “pkg-config --libs ftgl” for BF_FTGL_LIBS.
     - debian/patches/10_use_systemwide_ftgl:
        - Add it, needed since upstream doesn't support (yet) building
          with a system-wide FTGL library. Forwarded upstream.
     - debian/patches/20_fix_ftbfs_with_latest_ftgl:
        - Add it, needed due to upstream changes in FTGL. An include of
          GL/gl.h is missing, and the FTGL Advance(…) function calls are
          now to be replaced with Advance(…).Xf() ones. Not forwarded
          upstream yet, waiting for API stabilization first.
  * debian/pyversions:
     - Add it, set to “2.5” to ensure byte-compilation only targets
       python2.5, since there are now scripts using python2.5-only syntax.
  * debian/blender-wrapper:
     - Be more gentle when used over NFS: Don't write the revision when it
       wasn't changed since the last time blender was run. The possible
       write delay might trigger reading an empty string from that file.
     - Also be more robust, check for empty strings when reading from
       VERSION and REVISION files.
  * debian/source.lintian-overrides:
     - Drop it, no longer needed since upstream no longer ships .svn/*
       files.
  * debian/control:
     - Add libopenal-dev and libalut-dev to B-D, now builds fine with
       them. That also makes it clear that no internal copy of openal is
       used (Closes: #323527).

blender (2.45-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * debian/control:
     - Adjust Maintainer and Uploaders according to last years' activity.
     - Update my mail address. Many thanks to Florian Ernst who sponsored
       all my uploads.
  * Switch from python2.4 to python2.5 (Closes: #477761):
     - Replace python2.4-dev with python2.5-dev in Build-Depends.
     - Refresh the following patch to set BF_PYTHON_VERSION accordingly:
        - 50_debian_build_config.
  * Fix CVE-2008-1102: “Stack-based buffer overflow in the imb_loadhdr
    function allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via a .blend file that contains a crafted Radiance RGBE image.”
    Add upstream patch as pointed to by Tomas Hoger <thoger@redhat.com>
    (thanks!), which basically adds a check on sscanf() return code and
    limits the size of accepted %s parameters (Closes: #477808):
     - 30_fix_CVE-2008-1102.
  * Bump urgency to “high” accordingly.
  * Disable the “-Wdeclaration-after-statement” C_WARN flag (which is only
    valid for C/ObjC but not for C++) in config/linux2-config.py, by
    updating the following patch:
     - 50_debian_build_config.
  * Use DEB_HOST_ARCH to determine whether the host architecture is
    big-endian so as to pass an extra “-D__BIG_ENDIAN__” flag to the
    compiler, thus fixing the buggy endianness detection (upstream lists
    every platform, but misses at least hppa, mips, and s390). Thanks to
    Stefan Gartner for the tip (Closes: #441216).
  * Make scons understand what is wanted from it:
     - Pass “-g” and “-O” options through CFLAGS.
     - Pass “-D” options through CPPFLAGS.
  * Add patch to make blender able to use the compatibility layer that
    scons is setting up for its Option->Variable transition, initiated in
    scons 0.98.2-1 (deprecation will follow, but Blender should be updated
    upstream in the meanwhile), thanks to Mark Brown (see #477912):
     - 40_workaround_scons_options_deprecation.
  * Switch from ttf-bitstream-vera to ttf-dejavu (Closes: #463749), thanks
    to Sven Arvidsson:
     - debian/control: Update Depends.
     - debian/rules: Update symlink.

  * Fix FTBFS with gcc-4.3 by refreshing the following patch, fixing the
    yafray code, enabled again in the 2.45-3 upload (Closes: #462116):
     - 20_gcc4.3_support.
  * Delete the versions from the B-D on ftgl-dev and gettext; since they
    are even satisfied in oldstable, it doesn't make sense to keep them.

blender (2.45-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update the following patch to make YafRay available in the list of
    renderers again (Closes: #462949):
     - 50_debian_build_config.
  * Install the bpymodules/ directory in /usr/share/blender/scripts
    instead of under the blender/ subdirectory. This way, no special-case
    is needed when dealing with the creation of the symlinks in the user's
    ~/.blender/scripts directory, and it's not possible for another
    package to ship such a directory either (possibly preventing corner
    cases). As a side note, having this directory right under scripts/ is
    needed because the modules it contains are accessed through a
    hardcoded path (Closes: #463162).
  * Modify the wrapper again:
     - Extend the detection of the need for a migration to this revision.
     - Use straightforward syntax for the “dpkg --compare-versions” call,
       thanks Florian Ernst.
     - Ensure the scripts/ directory is present.
     - Adjust the creation of the bpydata symlink.
     - Fix the removal of the locale symlink (which is no longer needed).

blender (2.45-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ User-visible changes ]
  * Rework the blender wrapper. As it was written, it might discard user
    customization in the ~/.blender directory. Now, a subdirectory named
    after the previous version number is created, and previous
    configuration items are stored there before updating to the latest
    data shipped by upstream. This way, last features are available by
    default, while previous configuration is still accessible if needed.
  * The wrapper also used to create many symlinks under ~/.blender/scripts
    and has now been modified to rather create a single symlink per
    package. Other packages can now ship Blender scripts under
    /usr/share/blender/scripts/$package, and a symlink to this directory
    will be added automatically during the next startup.
  * Previous links (to /usr/lib/blender/…) should also be removed
    automatically.
  * Add “-W” to the “Exec” key of blender-fullscreen.desktop, so that
    Blender is really launched fullscreen (without window borders and
    possible decorations). It's still amazing to see how collaborative
    developers from sister distributions can be.

  [ Great cleanup ]
  * Switch from python-central to python-support:
     - debian/control:
        - B-D: Replace python-central with python-support.
        - B-D: Replace python2.4-dev with python-dev.
        - Drop python-centralish additional fields: X{S,B}-Python-Version.
     - debian/rules:
        - Replace dh_pycentral with dh_pysupport.
  * Remove the homepage from the long description.
  * Remove the binary and source lintian overrides about the additional
    “Homepage” source field, which is now official.
  * Replace many “install” calls in debian/rules by a call to“
    dh_install” and appropriate lines in debian/blender.install.That also
    fixes the spurious installation of the SVG icon in a 32x32 icon folder.
  * Move the locales where they belong: /usr/share/locale. Remove the symlink
    from the wrapper, it is no longer needed.
  * Remove the dot from the filenames of the Blanguages and bfont.ttf files,
    so that they no longer appear as hidden. Also move them to /usr/share.
    Modify the wrapper accordingly, so that it symlinks to the new locations.
    Also add a TODO about a possible removal of the font symlink.
  * Also move the scripts hierarchy and the VERSION file to /usr/share. Adapt
    the wrapper for this purpose too. Adapt the “chmod” call in debian/rules
    accordingly.
  * Drop the optimization lowering on mips(el) from debian/rules, although
    #354439 isn't marked as fixed yet. Thanks to Arthur Loiret for checking
    that the build goes fine with current gcc version.
  * Actually drop the “ccache” detection introduced in 2.45-1. Setting the
    PATH is much more straightforward.
  * General cleanup of debian/rules, especially superfluous use of $(CURDIR).
  * Delete “image-file-in-usr-lib” lintian override. No longer needed due to
    the /usr/lib to /usr/share migration of most of the files (nor really
    justified anyway).
  * No longer ship bfont.ttf directly since it is a duplicate of Bitstream
    Vera. Ship a symlink to the appopriate font and add a Depends: on the
    ttf-bitstream-vera package. Thanks linda.
  * Modify the handling of the config.* files. They are listed at the top of
    debian/rules and this list should be refreshed for each upstream release.
  * Modify the tweaks for the build of the plugins, using a symlink now.
  * Move the conditional addition (on Linux architectures only) of libdc1394
    to the patch against config/linux2-config.py.
  * Convert the patch system from dpatch to quilt. As a reminder, they are
    currently:
     - 02_tmp_in_HOME, by Florian Ernst:
         Create all temporary user data in $HOME/.blender, preventing
         possible security issues (e.g. symlink attacks, see #298167).
     - 04_de_po_fix, by Florian Ernst:
         Little fixes for de.po, by Jens Seidel <jensseidel@users.sf.net>,
         reported to the upstream patch tracker as #7823.
     - 10_gnukfreebsd_support by me:
         Add support for GNU/kFreeBSD in upstream files, see #388349.
     - 20_gcc4.3_support by me:
         Fix FTBFS with GCC 4.3 (Closes: #462116).
     - 50_debian_build_config by me:
         Customize the upstream default Linux configuration. Diffs are
         listed in TODO at the moment, until a dedicated file is added.
  * Modify the handling of user-config.py: config/linux2-config is now
    symlinked at build time from user-config.py, so that non-Linux
    architectures use it, although the auto-detection doesn't find the
    matching configuration file. The symlink is removed at clean time.
  * Drop no longer needed files:
     - debian/dirs
     - debian/genpot/*
     - debian/misc/user-config.py
     - debian/pot-header.txt
     - debian/pycompat
  * Adapt the wrapper so that other packages can ship scripts under a
    given directory (/usr/share/blender/scripts/$package) and that those
    scripts are taken into account when blender is started (using the same
    symlink mechanism that was already present for the scripts shipped
    with blender).
  * Update the menu file, providing with better long titles, thanks to
    Bill Allombert (Closes: #445154).
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no change needed).
  * Add Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields, pointing to collab-maint.
  * Remove debian/README.Alioth-CVS accordingly.
  * Remove debian/NEWS: no longer needed, and debian/README contains
    updated information.
  * No longer run “uupdate” in debian/watch.
  * Drop linda overrides, it looks like a outdated and deprecated tool.
  * Remove Florian Ernst from Uploaders upon his request, thanks for
    your taking care of Blender until now!

blender (2.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #443278).
  * Menu transition: move from Apps/Graphics to Applications/Graphics.
  * Dropped patch (merged upstream):
     - 20_gcc4.3_support.dpatch.
  * Disabled genpot in debian/rules. It is very time consuming, and apparently
    not needed. If a regression happens, it should be fixed upstream, and not
    using such a hack (that nobody knows about anymore). The genpot/ folder
    hadn't be deleted (yet), just in case. Since these scripts aren't called
    anymore, no .pyc file should appear, which fixes the double-build failure
    (Closes: #442511).
  * Added a “Homepage:” field, and kept the URL in the long description,
    until packages.debian.org, aptitude, and so on support this field.
  * Modified debian/rules to detect when DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains
    “ccache”, so as to speed up maintainer rebuilds.
  * Updated lintian source overrides so that only the following ones remain:
     - “unknown-field-in-dsc homepage” (see above);
     - .svn files in the upstream source.
  * Updated lintian binary overrides:
     - deleted unused ones;
     - added “unknown-field-in-control homepage”;
  * Updated desktop files:
     - removed unneeded “Encoding” field;
     - updated “Category” field “Application;Graphics;” to
       “Graphics;3DGraphics;”.

     - one missing newline;
     - one redefinition.
    (Closes: #417491)

blender (2.43-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #414409).
  * Refreshed 10_gnukfreebsd_support.dpatch:
     - it should now support each FreeBSD kernel version, using startswith()
       instead of an hardcoded kernel version string;
     - nan_compile.mk and some other files are no longer patched, although the
       compilation is OK; adjustments might be needed.
  * Updated user-config.py:
     - fixed () vs {} for FFMPEG;
     - switched from 'bullet' to 'bullet2' and adjusted some paths.
  * Added a Build-Conflicts against nvidia-glx. When trying to build with that
    package installed, a ``-lGL not found otherwise'' occurs, and without it,
    everything looks fine. That should also avoid situations like in #282071
    and #285946.
  * Added debian/patches/01_64bits_stupidity.dpatch to enable blender on
    64-bit systems. Please read the README.Debian file for more info. A
    NEWS.Debian file has been added to ensure that users don't miss this
    point.
  * Adjusted README.Debian file so that it has the very same structure as a
    debian changelog file.
  * Adjusted the clean target since many binary files remained after the
    cleanup, reported by dpkg-buildpackage when trying to update the Debian
    diff after a build (Closes: #424145).
  * Adjusted the width of the lines in the long description to get a possibly
    beautiful paragraph.
  * Updated and improved desktop integration (Closes: #417901):
     - switched from a single desktop file to two versions: one for windowed
       and one for fullscreen execution, thanks to Lukas Fittl for the
       suggestion!
     - added the missing dh_desktop call;
     - added the installation of all the icons in release/freedesktop/icons;
     - adapted the icon name in the .desktop files accordingly.
  * Dropped insecure script removal introduced in 2.42a-6, since the insecure
    script is no longer shipped upstream.
  * Added a TODO(.Debian) file to list items to work on for further revisions.

  [ Florian Ernst ]
  * debian/control:
    + drop g++-3.3 from B-D. Actually, we don't need it anymore.

    - Add 10_gnukfreebsd_support.dpatch to solve GNU/kFreeBSD detection in
      SConstruct files and other #define's.
    - Conditionalize the removal of "libdc1394" in debian/rules because it is
      Linux-specific and used unconditionally. Should be more easy to maintain
      this way than having multiple user-config.py files.

  [ Florian Ernst ]
  * Fall back to using gcc-3.4/g++-3.4 on mips and mipsel in order to
    circumvent ICE, see bug#354439.
  * Merge changes from Ubuntu:
    - debian/genpot: Add python scripts from Lee June <blender@eyou.com> to
      generate a reasonable PO template from the sources. Since gettext is used
      in a highly nonstandard way, xgettext does not work for this job.
    - debian/rules: Call the scripts, generate po/blender.pot, and clean it up
      in the clean target.
    - Add a proper header to the generated PO template.
  * Readd B-D on autotools-dev for auto-updating of config.{sub,guess},

    make sure all temporary user data (such as e.g. autosave files) is put
    in $HOME/.blender in order to avoid a symlink attack, see bug#298167

    $HOME/.blender
