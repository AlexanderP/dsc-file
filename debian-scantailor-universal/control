Description: Interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages
 Scan Tailor Universal is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned
 pages. It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/
 removing borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you get pages
 ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file. Scanning,
 optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are
 out of scope of this project.
