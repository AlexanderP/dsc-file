_Description: Do you want MusE to run with superuser rights?
 For good timing, MusE needs to set the real time clock (/dev/rtc) to a
 higher clock rate, and raise its scheduling priority. Usually, only the
 root user is allowed to do so. MusE can be installed "suid-root", so
 that it always runs with superuser capabilities. This is convenient, but
 programming errors in MusE likely present a hazard for system security in
 this setup.
 .
 File /usr/share/doc/muse/README.Debian summarizes several more secure
 methods to meet the timing requirements, but they all require manual
 configuration.
 .
 If you intend to use MusE for timing-sensitive recordings, and security
 is of no concern on this computer, opt for the suid-root installation
 by giving an affirmative answer to this question. Deny if unsure.
