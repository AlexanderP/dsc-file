"For good timing, MusE needs to set the real time clock (/dev/rtc) to a "
"higher clock rate, and raise its scheduling priority. Usually, only the root "
"user is allowed to do so. MusE can be installed \"suid-root\", so that it "
"always runs with superuser capabilities. This is convenient, but programming "
"errors in MusE likely present a hazard for system security in this setup."

"If you intend to use MusE for timing-sensitive recordings, and security is "
"of no concern on this computer, opt for the suid-root installation by giving "
"an affirmative answer to this question. Deny if unsure."
