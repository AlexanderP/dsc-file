Description: audio extraction tool for sampling CDs 
 Rubyripper aims to deliver high quality rips from audio 
 cd's to your computer drive. It tries to do so by ripping 
 the same track with cdparanoia multiple  times and then 
 comparing the results. It currently has a gtk2 and  a 
 command-line interface.
