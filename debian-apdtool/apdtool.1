.SH OPTIONS
A description of each of the supported options is included below.
.TP
.B \-o,\-\-output=[DIR or FILENAME]
Specify the image output directory or output file name.
Output to the current directory by default.

 <blend image>
 If it is not an existing directory path name, it will
 be treated as an output file name.
 If the output file name is specified, the output format
 is determined from the extension.
 If a directory is specified, the output file name will
 be "input file name + extension".

 <Layer output>
 The directory is always specified.
.TP
.B \-i,\-\-info
Outputs layer information. No image output is performed.
.TP
.B \-f,\-\-format=[TYPE]
Specify the output format of the composite image or layer
image. default:png

png/bmp/psd
.TP
.B \-G,\-\-gray
Outputs in grayscale for blend image. In the case of
PNG/PSD, it becomes 8-bit grayscale color.
.TP
.B \-M,\-\-mono

For blend image, it is output in monochrome. In the
case of PNG/PSD, it is 1bit grayscale color.
.TP
.B \-l,\-\-layer
Outputs the layer image in RGBA color. By default,
all layers except folders are targeted.

By default, the output file name is "input file
name + '_' + serial number + extension".
.TP
.B \-p,\-\-layer-prefix=[PREFIX]
Specify the prefix of the output file name when outputting
layers. * Specify the output directory with --output.

The output file name will be "PREFIX + serial number +
extension". If you specify an empty string with '-p ""',
you can use only the serial number.
.TP
.B \-n,\-\-layer-no=[n,n1-n2,...]
When outputting a layer, specify multiple index numbers of
the target layer.

The numbers start at 0 and can be specified as a single
unit, such as "0,1,2", or as a range, such as "0-5,10-20".
Separate each value with ','.

The layer index number can be checked with --info.
.TP
.B \-z,\-\-layer-no-tex
Does not apply the layer texture to the image when
outputting layers.
.TP
.B \-s,\-\-texpath-sys=[PATH]
Specify the directory path of the system texture image.

The default is the current directory.
.TP
.B \-u,\-\-texpath-user=[PATH]
Specify the directory path of the texture image of the user.

The default is "~/.azpainter/texture".
.TP
.B \-T,\-\-texlist=[FILENAME]

Outputs the path of the layer texture of all input files
to a text file.

FILENAME is the name of the text file to be output.
No image is output.
.TP
.B \-t,\-\-texcol=[FILENAME]
(When outputting blend image or layer)

Load texture path and color information from FILENAME text
file.  If the layer texture used in the A16bit/A1bit layer
matches the path,  replace the line color of the layer with
the specified color and invalidate the texture.

Use when you want to convert a tone image to a grayscalecolor.

In the text, a leading ';' is treated as a comment.  One line
describes the texture path and the color information to be
replaced.  There are two types of color specification.

path/file@[0-100] : Density(%). 0=white,100=black

path/file#[0-255] : 8bit color. 0=black,255=white

Ex: tone/60_20.png@20

This is valid only when the end of the line is a single-byte
number and  there is an @ or # within 4 characters from the end,
and the other lines are ignored (color replacement is not performed).

[â€»important point]

If the layer images to be replaced overlap in multiple layers,
the lighter colors may be displayed on the darker colors unless
the darker texture layers are arranged in order from the top.
In that case, change the order of the layers in the original file.
.TP
.B \-V,\-\-version
Displays version information.
.TP
.B \-h,\-\-help
Displays help.
