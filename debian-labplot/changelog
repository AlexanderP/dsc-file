    curve as data source
  *  2a320c7c7 - [worksheet] allow to change the position/order of plots
    also for worksheets having an active layout.
  *  7abb6852b - [histogram] allow to use smooth rough data as the
    source for the histogram.
  *  a1f24278e - Simplified the logic for handling the key events in
    Matrix and Spreadsheet views - handle the key events directly
    instead of registering/unregistering shortcuts. This also solve the
    problem with spreadsheet and matrix not reacting on delete/backspace
    keys when being child of a workbook.
  *  c56626e65 - [fit] limit degree for Fourier fit depending on
    available data points
  *  2ad85a971 - [analysis] Simplify getting valid data
  *  478d31545 - [fit] simplify getting available data
  *  f9e3ba394 - * add availableRowCount() for Column to get number of
    valid and non-masked rows * [fit] limit polynomial order (degree) by
    number of available data points
  *  ee0180832 - [fit] Fix problem with manual specified zero evaluation
    range
  *  c6ebba63d - Allow to delete the selected cells in spreadsheet and
    in matrix via the backspace key.
  *  463857700 - [worksheet] theme reset in XYCurve and Axis.
  *  980d997fb - [fit] Fix switching between different fits
  *  8855deeeb - [fit] Fix parameter detection for custom model
  *  67d8739ed - [worksheet] simplified the handling of theme properties
    in worksheet and plot area.
  *  e46788bc9 - [worksheet] selection of the theme "Default" should
    really reset the properties to the default ones. Implemented this
    logic for worksheet and plot area. This also needs to be done for
    all other children of the plot now.
  *  4e9e3c2de - [analysis] data reduction with DateTime x-data.
  *  c21921221 - Fix build with JSON test
  *  4ab5ac2bd - Fixed the build with enabled MQTT.
  *  e750af0fd - enum class PlotDesignation
  *  48b196fc3 - enum -> enum class
  *  d5d4e2e5a - [spreadsheet] when doing the revers of values in the
    column, determine the last row containing a valid value and ignore
    all following rows. This works for numeric columns only at the
    moment.
  *  24a5903c9 - [spreadsheet] reverse values also for integer and big
    integer columns.
  *  0956aa359 - [spreasheet] when selecting a column in the
    spreadsheet, properly deselect all its parents to avoid multiple
    selection in the project explorer.
  *  b8b747852 - GIT_SILENT coding style
  *  90a75f559 - use strongly typed enum
  *  1fd02d495 - [spreadsheet] properly drop/mask values also for
    integer and big integer columns.
  *  598bad414 - Update Generic Name (T12810)
  *  b8d47623f - GIT_SILENT minor change
  *  67ae94229 - Use enum with switch-case instead of int if-else
    comparisons in DropValuesDialog and proper padding for the class
    members.
  *  6ea5b06d0 - [worksheet] improved the handling of the offset for
    axis tick labels (absolute distance to the axis line + tick length).
  *  89a96dcd8 - [fit] Fix crash when fit fails
  *  931569ecc - [analysis] properly initialize the pointer to the rough
    data vector in XYSoothCurve so we don't crash when recalculating the
    already saved smooth and rough data.
  *  16a7a31c9 - [worksheet] added additional handling for export of
    worksheet to png.
  *  e2b58e66b - Fix the windows build.
  *  3d3cc78b7 - [spreadsheet] minor fixes in DropValuesDialog: 1. fixed
    the wording 2. save and load the last used operator and properly
    show the relevant widgets on dialog open.
  *  c973b7449 - Minor layout fix in XYSmoothCurveDock.
  *  f8a6dc9c0 - [analysis] calculate and expose the rough values as the
    result of a smooth (data = smooth + rough).
  *  3eab84d65 - In PlotDataDialog call CartesianPlot::dataChanged()
    instead of CartesianPlot::scaleAuto() to cope with cases where the
    min and max values of the new curves to be added are equal to the
    current plot ranges, otherwise no curve retransform is called and
    the curves are not shown.
  *  ad7fbeebb - Don't allow to click the Ok-button and to close the
    export dialogs if the specified directory is not existing.
  *  85764f236 - Fix previous commit: no isnan for integer; they are
    always valid
  *  b59699f82 - [smooth] Fix maximum number of points for datetime data
  *  5ce3f2d80 - [spreadsheet] notify the user if wrong export path was
    provided in the export dialog.
  *  1234717a8 - Fix compilation
  *  1eac5e149 - [spreadsheet] show the trimian also in the statistics
    dialog.
