  *  19ca4d04c - UI: More string fixes
  *  8a7c3bacd - add changelog entry
  *  16ab29eb3 - add check if decimals is zero. In this case use the

  *  ded9b7d5f - use insidePlot directly
  *  a389f7a9c - If the Infoelement is the selected element during load,
    not all markerpoints have yet a curve assigned and therefore the
    check of the checkbox is not done. To fix this, the curvePath in the
    markerPoints and the plot curves are used. Now after loading the
    checkboxes are set correctly
  *  1ee240454 - visible Variable in InfoElementPrivate is not needed,
    use infrastructure of the WorksheetElement wherever possible

  *  701a1e655 - comment out not working part, let this test in for
    future implementations to speed up creating unittests

    datetimes in ms
  *  bc3fa1664 - add numberSpinboxTest
  *  6519b3f8d - use common function for both unitChanged() and
    unitChanged2()
  *  b18dfe99d - divide the range by 1000 is datetime is provided,
    because datetime is in milliseconds
  *  0d53a31f1 - do not use decimals() to format the number if the
    number is smaller than the minimum representation
  *  56523307c - the setMinimum() and setMaximum() of QDoubleSpinbox are
    rounding the value to the defined number of decimals, therefore
    entering really small numbers with high precision is not possible.
    Reimplement the function to get rid of this problem

  *  490691099 - add test

    already locked outside

  *  a3d72f0a0 - fix test
  *  ef56676de - add test
  *  e0535a08e - suppress setting also setCurrentIndex, because

    different coordinatesystem receives the coordinatesystem of the
    other, which is not desired
  *  5f7cadb66 - fix test
  *  5f8931a80 - do not set changed value, but just give feedback that
    the applied value is not valid. So the user knows from the tooltip
    which value he can set
  *  93c612df8 - remove not needed emit
  *  9744b0a0f - NumberSpinBox: disable waitFeedback after signal was
    emitted. In this case it is expected that due to the signal/slot a
    feedback is received and if not we are turning it directly of again.
    So it cannot happen that it gets forgottn to send the feedback
  *  c571479cd - cut the connection dock -> element -> (this) -> dock.
    Because in the case of the qlineedit, the cursor would be set to a
    wrong position and so the next letter will not be in the middle of
    the text, but at the end
  *  46eeec7ab - before every lock there must be a condition which
    checks if m_initializing is not already done. And in this case the
    function should not be executed
  *  a97de7785 - use Lock class wherever possible
  *  151f255ff - use everywhere the feedback feature. - use Lock class
    for locking instead of doing it manually

    behaviour
  *  2074585dc - do not update y range when zoom x is done, because then
    niceExtend() will be applied to y which changes the range even if it
    is set to manual. Also for x range this problem might occur
  *  b02195816 - add also test for common y

  *  d7b778731 - [spreadsheet] multiple minor fixes in the handling of
    selected columns in SpreadsheetView: * removed the usage of default
    QModelIndex() parameters in some of the calls in
    QItemSelectionModel. * in case the context menu is called by
    clicking one of the spreadsheet cells and the column underneath is
    fully selected, show the column specific column and not the global
    spreadsheet column. * reduced the number of selectedColumns() calls
    in the event filter. * changed the default value of the parameter
    full in selectedColumns() to true - this function is mostly called
    without this parameter and the default value is applied and in most
    of the cases this function is called when columns are fully
    selected. In such cases we should benefit from the faster
    QItemSelectionModel::isColumnSelected() used internally.
  *  7c0c4962a - invalidate before emiting dataChanged, otherwise it
    will the autoscaled wrongly
  *  271d357ea - when shift is done, autoscale shall not be done on the
    complete range, but only the one set by the other range
  *  30b63ffe0 - Update CartesianPlotTest.cpp and CartesianPlotTest.h
  *  09f0333ba - wrong function name in doxygen comment
  *  2e42a0416 - [worksheet] moved the isLoading-check into
    CartesianPlot::checkAxisFormat() instead of doing this check in
    multiple places when checkAxisFormat() is being called.
  *  0eca587d4 - missing PROJECT_SAVE stuff
  *  5a12be831 - another missing isLoading() is needed
  *  0e9ee2ddd - do not checkAxisFormat while loading, because format
    should not be overwritten. Fixes #74
  *  af92e2906 - move restorePointers to the end, because state is in
    the ProjectExplorer. In the tests, it will not be created and
    therefore restorePointers will never called in the tests
  *  ed62a9e8c - GIT_SILENT Sync po/docbooks with svn
  *  ecddbdd20 - Qt6: QDirModel->QFileSystemModel
  *  b679fe9ea - - delete logical points, if x or y column gets deleted,
    because data cannot be valid anymore - if xColumn not available, do
    not calculate scenepoints because calculateScenePoints needs xColumn
    and it make no sense to calculate fixes #407
  *  bd7bdc5dd - do not calculate scenepoints if filling is disabled
  *  ba8b44b7a - dirty must be set to true
  *  60964756f - clear m_scenePoints, to release memory, because they
    have to be recalculated before using it

  * Commit: a3e2be722f63264d4ba84b21749f6fcd83d2db5a
  * Date: 1664223745
  * git changelog:
  *  a3e2be722 - Minor improvements: * when changing search options in
    the Project Explorer (enable fuzzy search, etc.), don't do any
    search when the current search string is empty - this can save
    performance with very many objects in the project * don't show any
    frame for the range related ComboBoxes in plot's properties widget.
  *  fd655bd96 - Renamed Plot, xy-Plot and Cartesian Plot to Plot Area,
    s.a. the discussion in #380.

    cumulative percentage values in the Pareto plot in the column
    statistics widget and use system's font size for values.

    beginning, so the plot is also set then
  *  e3e7e72df - when adding a new axis and the coordinatesystem will be
    set, retransformRange() will be called. Due to the missing plot and
    csystem the application crashes. This is because the axis gets child
    of the plot after all properties are set correctly
  *  afd15ba16 - fixed clang format.
  *  30c90d7e6 - [spreadsheet] improvements in the handling of values
    labels: * when adding value labels for text columns, show all

    faster * set the project to 'modified' when the value labels were
    changed in the column
  *  65799ec4c - fix tests
  *  9bdffe8e6 - add Test
  *  a759f89fe - retransform changed scales, otherwise the ranges are
    not adapted.
  *  be4577646 - plotRangeChanged() is already defined in the BaseDock,
    so no need to reimplement again
  *  cad413938 - [worksheet] improvements in the worksheet view: * don't
    allow to zoom with the mouse wheel if the view was set to
    'interactive' * don't crash when using view shortcuts in the
    interactive mode like in the column statistics widget * remove
    handling of shortcuts 'x' and 'y' in the worksheet view that collide
    with the shortcuts in the plot

    columns.
  *  21e5c3e96 - use already existing script to format. Otherwise the
    behaviour might be different
  *  10d0a7470 - add missing include
  *  18daccc5b - retransforscale must be done also if no autoscale is
    done, otherwise the axes lines are not drawn at the correct
    position, because the cSystem scales are not recaculated
  *  301b35c19 - Column: add IndexForValue test

  * git changelog:
  *  3c88c367f - [histogram] minor fixes and improvements: 1.  don't use
    any pen when drawing the shape of the histogram otherwise we're left
    with unwanted line if no line is actually selected.  Fixed the same
    issue also for the box and bar plots. 2.  rename the properties Line
    to Shape to make more clear what we're dealing with here. 3.
    disable filling properties if they don't make any sense,  i.e.  if
    the shape type other than bars or envelope was selected.

    we don't show this label in other places, by using KMessageWidget
    it's clear it's about errors * use Latin Modern Roman as the default
    font in case lualatex is used since Computer Modern is not supported
    by this compiler * for xelatex und lualatex, use the fontspec-
    package instead of xltxtra since the latter is outdated and is
    available for xelatex only

  *  1ff222857 - Check also in second test that retransformScale is
    called correctly
  *  56c6b6b59 - must be ifdef instead of only if
  *  fc5f0c540 - set autoscale in test project. Check
    retransformX/YScale how ofter they are called
  *  462cfee1d - use WorksheetElementContainer in the internal functions
    so from outside it stays retransform()
  *  4a1e22956 - setHorizontalPadding calls afterwards the private
    retransform of CartesianPlot and therefore here the childs must also
    be updated. So move everything from the private retransform in it's
    own function and call this function in finalizeLoad() so the childs
    are not updated two times
  *  4f8a05cfb - add images and textlabel to project
  *  c2900e3aa - no need to call d->retransform() which is included in
    retransform() again, just retransform the childs
  *  e613c8237 - do not call recursive, because cartesian plot is
    already doing
  *  bac35d965 - use finalizeLoad() function instead of calling all
    three functions by it self
  *  70d79ced2 - must be ifdef not only if
  *  1c6bc1859 - use hash instead of list and add expected call count
    there
  *  f884a162f - remove default values, because not needed and it is
    just dangerous
  *  45829f054 - remove suppressRetransform flag, because it will be
    suppressed everywhere
  *  b3afff308 - format
  *  c4aa47bde - the datarect must be updated, because the rect changes.
    Therefore also the scales change and the childs must be
    retransformed
  *  4dedc7337 - finalize load must be used, otherwise the axis are not
    visible, because retransformScales() is never called
  *  f7b774421 - use finalize load
  *  4d79e31c0 - retransforming only private is enough, because only
    datarect should be updated
  *  5343ff1c8 - put a few functions into one function so in the project
    it looks cleaner
  *  c427af7da - do recalculation of the equation curve, otherwise
    xColumn and yColumn are not updated and so autoscale in the
    cartesian plot will be wrong.
  *  0503e246f - fix compile issue
  *  c1c1f58c0 - fix
  *  6341d60ab - no need to call
  *  f0ad330b1 - only the defaultCoordinateSystem changes
  *  c0506759c - trying to get a clean structure how to retransform the
    cartesianplot and its children - do not retransform title and legend
    multiple times per retransform - do not retransformScales() every
    time, because it is done when changing the scales it self
  *  c99c7f153 - add comment
  *  a67370e5d - not needed, because this is already in
    retransformX/YScale it self
  *  8559f1de4 - add retransformTest
  *  13ff014b2 - [spreadsheet] when clearing the content of a column,
    also remove the definition of the formula, if available.
  *  5e77c1681 - 3rdparty: Fix couple of QXlsx warnings

    formatting and clear content actions in the column context menu if
    no values area available in the selected columns.
  *  ba4dbafe3 - [spreadsheet] imrovements for the row statistics item
    in the context menu: 1. don't show any row statistics item if no
    numeric values are available in the current selection 2. faster
    iteration over the selected rows, utilize the selection model in the
    view for this 3. fixed i18n for strings in the title of the
    statistics dialog
  *  4aeb51ba4 - [spreadsheet] better logic for the names of new columns
    added to the spreadsheet via the project explorer, ensure continious
    numbering.
  *  2acef4504 - Don't set the project to modified if it was created
    during the application start-up since nothing has changed from
    user's perspective.

    and remove signals when adding/removing multiple columns * use a
    better initial column name to avoig expensive renaming to ensure the
    uniquness of the name * remove some debug output that becomes
    expensive when handling with many columns

    SpreasheetView when when adding new columns during the import,  no
    need for it 2.  refactored the creation of the column context menu

  *  2de506c25 - use relative path to the search path if the item is
    located in a subfolder
  *  2ed98dc59 - use also a custom search path to reuse the listview
    also there. So the user selects a custom path and in the listview
    all elements are visible
  *  0da776c85 - New proposal to handle custom folders in the
    PlotTemplaDialog and use Worksheet::setInteractive() to disable
    zooming and navigation in the preview plot.
  *  9c8b79ab1 - restore pointers after loading the plot. So it is
    possible to have curves and infoelements in the template and they
    receive then the data assigned
  *  a53e4caba - due to the lock(mLoading) changePreviewSource will not
    be called. leave the lock to trigger updating the plot. react on
    stateChanged, because it is also triggered if the checkBox is set
    programatically

    possible to add elements to the plot because they are not applied

    plot templates to the place where other theme and templates related
    buttons are already shown * better icons and wording * save and
    restore the size of the plot template dialog

  *  b46928bb9 - [3rdparty] use latest QXlsx
  *  68ae48530 - Element specific default values for the background
    opacity in Background, we need smaller opacity values for the inital
    box filling in the box plot, etc.

  *  34d4afa67 - Added an option to control whether to show the enabled
    option for the background properties or not. This option is not
    needed everywhere and will be activated in specific cases only.
  *  0baddff29 - Use the new class Background in Worksheet.
  *  20af31a68 - Initial implementation of the classes Background and
    BackgroundWidget.

  *  f9541b44b - rename functions to a more appropriate name
  *  dbde64506 - no need to increase the buildXmlVersion, because if the
    parameter is not available, it will be already ignored in the
    READ_INT_VALUE macro
  *  91b8075cf - do not automatically change the tick number if not
    desired. Implement a auto checkbox to choose if automatic tick
    numbering is desired or not.

    resolve ours
  *  45db4f364 - GIT_SILENT made messages (after extraction)

    the orientation via the context menu and better icons for this
    action.

    must be divided, because due to the usage of the factor in the
    formulas below, the numberOfPixelX will be multiplied which is
    correct
  *  5f1293f71 - can be moved outside
  *  a0f4c4e24 - - move condition out of the loop to speedup - remove
    abs, because it matters only if the value is unequal to zero -
    qround64 must not be calculated every time
  *  efbcd62c2 - Edit textlabels correctly. Due to the usage of html
    code it is not easily possible to change the properties of the text
    without changing the content. Therefore a QTextEdit will be used.
    The text will be stored into the textedit, the changes are applied
    and then the text will be written back into the textlabel. So
    properties can be applied to multiple labels at the same time
    without changing any other property or content. fixes #188

    initially and wants to override the changes by applying the same

    optimization behind a version check.
  *  908d7d1ea - [ascii] faster reading in AsciiFilter.
  *  24b0c57f3 - Fixes: * use endInsertRows() when inserting new rows in
    the model and not endRemoveRows() * make the new columns created in
    finalizeImport() undo aware after their sizes were changed
  *  1c7b16dc9 - get spicefilter working

  *  687b8ee6d - tests: make ascii test a common test
  *  d44074f13 - Use std::fabs() instead of std::abs() for double values
    in SpiceReader.cpp. The privous commit has fixed the build on macos
    but was semantically wrong, this commit corrects the behavior now.
  *  050c353ab - Fixed the build on macos that was failing because of an
    ambigous call when passing an double to abs() that is expecting
    either an int or a long.
  *  f3f34e61a - add missing header
  *  0fe866021 - BinaryFilter: improve progress bar

    with the current percentage of the import progress during the import
    of big ASCII and JSON files.
  *  0941fdab0 - [ascii] removed some debug output in the function that
    is very hot during the improt. This give ca. 1s performance for a
    2.9GB file.
  *  ae0b024f2 - tests: add binary import test
  *  340f7bd4f - [spreadsheet] removed obsolete QVector::resize() calls
    in prepareImport.
  *  6da9df45c - Added c++ code to generate ASCII and binary test data
    based on Brownian motion example. This is similar to the already
    existing python script but significantly faster) and can be used to
    generate big data sets (multiple millions of rows).
  *  6ff2a2b28 - [spreadsheet] no need to have two functions
    handleRowsInterted and handleRowsRemoved in SpreadsheetModel doing
    the same. One function is enough.
  *  bd4cfd4d1 - Replaced QVector<bool> by std::vector<bool> in XYCurve
    and in BoxPlot. This will reduce the memory consumption for the
    containers holding the information about the visible points by a
    factor of 8.
  *  f491af70f - [spreadsheet] no need to hold QVector<int> for the
    vertical header in the spreadsheet model. The text shown in the
    vertical header can be directly mapped to the row/section of the
    spreadsheet and we don't need any additional container.

  *  1c5c7dc06 - [spreadsheet] the fix done in
    d4c61765d657b6ad4dfc4db3c082a16e7cdb954d has caused test failures on
    windows and freebsd which are not clear and which don't happen on
    linux. Reworking the fix trying to adress the test failures.
  *  b458e9aa8 - SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file) - always
    resolve ours
  *  249ccd6b7 - GIT_SILENT made messages (after extraction)
  *  d4c61765d - [spreadsheet] changed the ownership of SpreadsheetModel
    -  make Spreadsheet owning it and not SpreadsheetView,  to make sure
    spreadsheet's children columns are not deleted when the view is
    closed and the model is deleted.
  *  2d995cf1c - CI: make failing tests fatal
  *  0e1e909b1 - Removed the usage of the depricated function
    QWheelEvent::delta(), use QWheelEvent::angleDelta() instead.

    CAS backends installed or found.
  *  fe6789f0f - [histogram] re-wrote the algorithm to calculate the

    correctly drawn when zooming in and out and when switching the
    orientation.

    hide the text field for vector/column names if use first row for
    name the vectors option is used in AsciiOptionsWidget * don't
    simplify the SQL query string in ImportSQLDatabaseWidget when saving
    the last used query, we want to keep the line breaks provided by the
    user * added tooltip text for the Refresh button in
    ImportSQLDatabaseWidget * removed Ankit from the license header in
    ImportSQLDatabaseWidget, he never contributed to it
  *  27ef7efd5 - worksheet element: fix positionwrapper initialization
  *  777122b43 - must be connected to positionLogicalChanged, otherwise

  * Commit: b100ff2581820abd3690bed7896c01d447f954f1
  * Date: 1643645425
  * git changelog:
  *  b100ff258 - unused code
  *  206d493ed - fix #94 Duplicate of a worksheet with a plot doesn't
    work
  *  e2d52fda2 - when coordinateBinding was changed in the label or the
    custompoint, notify the dock, otherwise it will not be updated
  *  ce0a66c4d - update position to update the logical position variable
  *  7f2016b7f - missing retransform, otherwise the image will not be
    placed correctly
  *  d86a128a5 - fix wrong initial positioning of the custompoint. A
    logical position was set to the relativePosition variable, which is
    wrong
  *  2de6ce810 - set Position after adding as child, otherwise the
    position will not be set correctly, because parent datarect is not
    available and therefore alignment does not work correctly
  *  0641a13ec - - move setting the graphicsItem position to
    WorksheetElement, so it can be used for every element. # Conflicts:
    # src/backend/worksheet/WorksheetElement.cpp #
    src/backend/worksheet/plots/cartesian/CustomPoint.cpp
  *  ad3975a23 - update application icons
  *  52a935459 - [worksheet] when mapping logical to scene coordinates,
    properly set the elements for visible points vector to true or false
    instead of just negating their current value.
  *  e0464dcf9 - changelog
  *  5dc145a0e - label: fix restoring selection for color changes
  *  a32b93bac - label: fix updating label when background color changes
  *  b4168f8fc - Merge branch 'master' into labelBackgroundColor
  *  5e00399df - plot: Fix enabling auto scaling and clean up (fixing
    multi range test)
  *  365400fd5 - tests: fix OPJ import range checks
  *  e981e27d1 - [plot] correctly set auto scale on ranges and save/load
    them properly
  *  af35b0ba4 - code style fixes
  *  dd48e112a - when setting a custompoint logical position,
    coordinatebinding must also be enabled, otherwise it will fail
  *  12c86db0a - boundingRect() is already in WorksheetElement
  *  9e46eae91 - the boundinRectangle variable is not used and is
    already in the worksheetElement. Remove transformedBoundingRectangle
    because it is not needed. boundingRectangle can be used
  *  6c6fc8dd6 - use boundingrect() function, because custompoints
    reimplements this function and does not use the boundingRectVariable
  *  8b8da12be - must be positionLogical, when logical Position is
    passed
  *  f0b6e55e4 - [worksheet] don't show any context menu if the label is
    hidden which is the case for example for axis and plot title labels.
    For such objects the context menu of their parents, i.e. of axis and
    plot, is used.
  *  2fdba0417 - improve label background and better debugging
  *  ad1ce006c - [worksheet] set the minimum size of the text edit
    widget to one row of a QLineEdit and some other minor layout fixes
    in LabelWidget.

  *  d0c57b533 - [notebook] delay the initialization of plugins to a
    point when they are really requests and show the documentation panel
    if it's requested in the notebook.
  *  9ac93da66 - make negative sign when cursor2 is smaller than cursor1
    so it is as when the value is not a datetime
  *  95cdda883 - implement visibilityChanged() in WorksheetElement, so
    only one signal for emiting that visibility changed. Not like in the
    case of the XYCurve visibilityChanged() and visibleChanged()
    existed. So the cursor dock was not updated, because the signal was
    not called
  *  b25008d0f - Fix compiler warnings

    text is visible, otherwise when changing it has no effect and the
    user may be wondered why it does not have an effect
  *  cdaef2a71 - ignore wheel on hovering combobox in the treeview
    otherwise the values are changed instead of scrolling in the
    tablewidget. When focusing a combobox by clicking it is possible to

  *  80f361ef2 - [worksheet] allow to position the vertical reference
    line also for DateTime x-ranges.
  *  45eb172e7 - differentiate between datetime and numeric, otherwise
    keypress for the infoelement will not work if the x axis is a
    datetime

    subscript
  *  dc3c400f9 - fixes #80
  *  61424b175 - tests: import OPJ import test
  *  df305c4f3 - [data extractor] when entering curve points, ignore the

    needed
  *  24519608b - - use template for setter and replace command - use
    different method for reading in columns. This method is much faster,
    because no undocommand will be created every time and the vector

  * Date: 1642172486
  * git changelog:
  *  1fb3dd080 - retransform must be done at least once, because the
    ranges change anyway even if no autscale is selected.

    simplified the logic to determine the bounding rectangle surrounding
    all visible sub-windows in MainWin for the project preview
    thumbnail.
  *  cb6407703 - cache the availability of min/max in own variable
  *  807f726ba - GIT_SILENT Updated README to use the last version of
    the description of features that we want to promote.
  *  5a5c79426 - reading must be done as in the Variableparser, because
    some dates are only valid in the UTC timezone
  *  bddbd7160 - Added the note about how to reference and cite LabPlot
    in literature to the README file.
  *  9c57457bf - Added new screenshots to AppData and added the note
    about how to reference and cite LabPlot in literature to the README
    file
  *  6e5376d41 - macOS: try fixing resolution
  *  75f3f5e67 - If previously the text was empty, the bounding rect is
    zero  therefore the alignment did not work properly.  If thext is
    added, the bounding rectangle is updated and then the position must
    be changed to consider alignment
  *  aba77ffa6 - add missing ampersands
  *  34a4ed70e - retransform plot after changing type
  *  64471d13b - rename variables. So TODOs can be removed
  *  28555f8f9 - removing not needed comments and general cleanup
  *  810115fd5 - - extend function to work also correctly for nonlinear
    axes - use last point always as reference point. If a point on the
    same pixel occured, don't use it as last point, otherwise it is not
    possible to draw a vertical line and a connection line to the next
    point
  *  32a0acd88 - do not draw first point, because there last Point is
    still NAN
  *  a251897a0 - add last line

  *  74a24b3a1 - move addLinearLine content into addLine function to
    reduce code size and because addLinearLine is not a big function
  *  70f47a0e9 - revert improvement
  *  9e1f3c0bc - auto scale: use default fullRange and add missing fix
  *  aa04bd525 - remove retransform from all scaleAuto functions,
    because of the multirange it makes no sense to suppress every time.
    So do a retransform only when needed. It is a big performance
    improvement
  *  375700289 - GIT_SILENT made messages (after extraction)
  *  0e54a024e - tests: more data change tests
  *  afc78c059 - tests: add cartesian plot test for data changes

    retransform every time an item was added.
  *  c61a62fb7 - do not forward QGraphicsItem::MousePressEvent when zoom
    selection is used. So the selection does not change.
  *  1c095ecb1 - m_data in the init() function will overwrite the data
    pointer from the constructor.
  *  71e714f7b - Updated the README file:

  *  76bd2fdf8 - cleanup
  *  ce020b849 - add const
  *  37a25ee80 - remove brackets in one liner
  *  10a55d09a - - rename formulaDatas to formulaData, because it is
    already plural - remove access to private member m_formulaData,
    because it makes no sense to access it.
  *  c3187b38e - remove argument, because it is already the default
  *  0c4b9dd69 - instead of using three Vectors (formulaVariableNames,
    formulaVariableColumns and formulaVariableColumnPaths) Which have to
    be synched, use a struct and store the data in there. So it is much
    easier to sync
  *  37623e449 - remove template so there is no need to include
    ColumnPrivate header into Column
  *  3062cc392 - add init function to avoid writing duplicate code

  *  43fae62a2 - [worksheet] similarly to drawValues() in XYCurve, use
    QPainter::drawText() instead of QPainter::drawPath() also in
    Histogram. drawText() is faster. This committhis also solves the
    problem with the wrong brush used to draw the values.
  *  916145974 - GIT_SILENT made messages (after extraction)
  *  150cae19a - [worksheet] removed the border and reduced the margins

    plotDesignationString()
  *  743517b61 - cleanup
  *  27e6a96b1 - position.point returns the position in scene
    coordinated and not the logical position which is stored in
    positionLogical()
  *  04de97127 - - remove xPos, because positionLogical exists -
    supressChildPositionChanged if the position of the custom point will
    be changed by the infoelement - move connects to the end, otherwise
    position changed of the custompoint will be called
  *  48fc6a7bd - - do not retransform, because it is done already in the
    Cartesian Plot. Retransform will crash labplot, because in
    retransform the plot datarect is used. - Check that setText does not
    call texlabelTextChanged of the infoelement, because this leads also
    to a call of retransform and the application will crash
  *  95933998e - SVN_SILENT made messages (.desktop file) - always
    resolve ours
  *  a4c0155bb - GIT_SILENT made messages (after extraction)

  *  4074e7158 - Fixing regressions introduced in
    eb21f0067273fd03ad70d476220fcf2e8da173f2: * recursively retransform
    all children when loading the project. This fixes projects like
    SameStats having folder structures that were not read. * when
    copying/duplicating an object, retransform only this object and its
    children and not all children in the project.
  *  5f1464b0e - scale axes on data changes in curves and better debug
    output

  *  6b533c215 - Fixes and improvements: 1. don't try to initialize the
    variable model in the notebook if the backend session is not
    available (backend is not installed for example). 2. renamed
    Datapicker to Data Extractor 3. allow to paste the column data via
    the context menu of the column similar to copy data 4. allow to

  *  108ebf617 - [notebook] fixes: * when replacing the values in the
    column, always resize to the size of the new array otherwise we end
    up having more elements in the column vector than the number of new
    values that were set. Relevant for the case when the count of the
    new values is smaller than the count of the old values. * added
    missing cases for all data types in dataChanged() slot * don't use
    any NAN for invalid integer values. It's not a correct int, we use 0
    right now for invalid integers until we have a proper solution for
    invalid/missing integers * fixed indentation

    openning a project which is helpful for heavy projects taking long
    to load. * change the current aspect in the project explorer when
    doing undo/redo. This was done differently in the past to avoid
    unwanted changes but it causes more problems, e.g. add Workbook,
    undo this step, add new Spreadsheet -> the spreadsheet is created as
    a child of the workbook... * use capital letters for the
    descriptions of the different sections in the overview tab in the
    column statistics dialog.

    the context menus of plot and worksheet until it's really required.
  *  93644f56e - Avoid too many updatePixmap() calls in the curves when
    openning a project that are caused by the initalization of symbol
    properties.
  *  9ceaed97f - [worksheet] when adding a new curve to the plot and
    changing the ranges and the axis tick labels, adjust the plot area
    padding if the axis title label is outside of the plot area.

    image is rescaled so the proper bounding rect is calculated.
  *  80c118990 - Add ability to turn off niceExtend fix #17
  *  7a28d534a - [worksheet] reduced the number of
    QPainterPath::moveTo() calls when calculating the line path in
    XYCurve. They are obsolete and seem to break the vectorization of
    the line path.
  *  71f688a32 - fix mimetype for projects
  *  0cba2a426 - [worksheet] keep the original image in Image.cpp so we
    can use it when rescaling the image later on size changes.

    the whisker types SD and MAD.
  *  81995382a - use new default colors
  *  a20bacb6b - another override
  *  725552845 - do not shift if an object different to the plot is
    used, because for example the infoelement catches also the key press
    events
  *  4685fea92 - Added missing override keywords in the new code.
  *  ed6d95f8a - set text should not automatically convert to html if
    the Textwrapper argument is string
  *  142a35155 - if the text is html coded, it makes no sense to set the
    FontColor, because it will not have an effect, but instead change
    the QLineEdit Text and then store this text in the Textlabel
  *  a0834b0a4 - clear selection after color is set
  *  53ba2a899 - Not necessary to set position every time. Only once is
    fine enough
  *  8fd106b0e - use the plot rect instead of the datarect as bounding
    rect. So the area of the textlabel is bigger. But for the vertical
    line still the datarect must be used
  *  d3230b76f - fix position issue of the infoelement
  *  088ed09df - after everything was loaded call dataChanged to scale
    all plots correctly
  *  9f87f576a - fix wrong index is scaled this might lead to a crash

    crashing
  *  2b8861cf1 - CartesianPlot: No assert
  *  80ac69358 - - remove retransform from CartesianPlot::load() - add
    child after text is set, otherwise retransform of the infoelement
    will be called, because text was changed and the signal slot
    connection is already there
  *  c221d8c9c - ReferenceLine: remove retransform()
  *  f1429d8ec - Custompoint: remove retransform()
  *  a475e3cfb - Image: remove retransform from scaleimage. So it will
    not be called during load
  *  d4dd440f7 - loading is already done a few lines above. No need to
    retransform again
  *  eb21f0067 - do a retransform also on elements directly in the
    worksheet not only the plots
  *  4604ad551 - set isLoading for all childs to false, otherwise no
    retransform is executed
  *  e0918a245 - no isloading check in
    CartesianPlotPrivate::retransform()
  *  b3f9abcb5 - Do not give a chance to retransform. Retransform after
    everything is loaded

  *  28085b0dc - emit positionChanged signal, otherwise the dock will
    not be notified
  *  8cc207297 - ItemChange is already implemented in worksheetelement
  *  e22d97f3c - limit infoElement exceeding the limits of the curve. -
    The info element stays at that position, but the logical value
    changes accross the limits of the x axis of the curve
  *  7b5689728 - Fix custom point wrong position shown in the dock
  *  601c2ebdc - if the keypress is used, do not pass it to the parent,
    otherwise two actions will be executed at the same time. - So when
    having an infoelement and the label should be move with the mouse
    cursors, the infoelement moves too, because it handles also the
    keypress event
  *  78ede95be - draw bounding rect if desired. For debugging purpose
    only
  *  7dd94d1ac - use plot rect only if the direct parent is a cartesian
    Plot. If not (for example the Custompoint or the label of the
    infoelement) use the parents bounding rect
  *  6620290e9 - set visible correct
  *  cf198b473 - retransform when rotated which calls
    recalcShapeAndBoundingRect()
  *  887e81f4a - boundingRect() instead of boundingRectangle must be
    used, because the Legend does not use the boundingRectangle variable
    and then the align is always zero
  *  7b167105d - Legend: Set correct initial values
  *  34326c046 - Align custompoint, legend and textlabel dock to look
    like the same and implement alignment for custompoint and legend
  *  a867804dc - Fix position issue of the InfoElement Custom point.
  *  93918f96e - Use WorksheetElementPrivate class in every Element
  *  3c09e9212 - Create WorksheetElementPrivate as Base class for all
    Worksheet Items.
  *  b57665af3 - [worksheet] when loading TextLabel we need to call
    updateBoundingRect() instead of retransform() to properly calculate
    the bounding rect for stored PDF content, adding the actual change
    in the cpp file now.
  *  7dc242a93 - [worksheet] when loading TextLabel we need to call
    updateBoundingRect() instead of retransform() to properly calculate
    the bounding rect for stored PDF content.

    nodes are expanded, etc., and the geometries of views, properly take
    care of the sub-folder structure.
  *  37d1c18dc - Properly register signal-slot connections in MainWin
    for workbook's children.
  *  d20b202db - Show the relevant actions in the context menu of
    spreadsheet and matrix also when they are chidlrend of a workbook
    and some general cleanup in AbstractPart.
  *  1fbaa8869 - Properly update the window title bar on undo/redo
    steps.

    AspectTreeModel::modelIndexOfAspect().
  *  94b80e29d - Minor fixes: 1. don't create any unwanted entries on
    the undo-stack when selecting a plot 2. use QStringLiteral instead
    of QString for AbstractAspect::typeName()
  *  596863447 - Save the current paths of the data columns if available
    instead of saving the last available column path. This fixes the
    issue when the spreadsheet was renamed and the connection to the new
    column paths was not properly saved and restored.
  *  c949e15b3 - Show only relevant objects in TreeViewComboBox.
  *  abd1aa21d - conflicts

    add it to workbook also when one of its children is currently

    the current workbook.
  *  6c5a9bd02 - Adding changes that were forgotten in the previous
    commits...
  *  969e1b2bc - [worksheet] properly resize the parent container in

    to use.
  *  eeef78232 - color scheme: try fixing problems with initial scheme
    on Windows
  *  356d26e58 - custompoint of the info element has not the plot as

  *  7a9ecca5d - implement key press reaction also for the logical
    coordinates
  *  d756ffc8a - fix taborder
  *  0fb618877 - invert movement, so key up and the textlabel goes up
  *  f21e04058 - Disable clipping, so the TextLabel can be placed also

    then.
  *  b54cbd902 - do not map to parent, because pr is the bounding rect
    of the plot not the parent
  *  31c8fc545 - fix alignment for logical coordinates
  *  6e198a40e - fix label positioning problems
  *  da6079196 - not only the direct parent must be a plot. There must
    only a plot set
  *  e19bde212 - No need to set the cSystem again. It is already done in
    the InfoElement it self
  *  8b9922f0f - fix element info custom point not visible. During
    finalizeAdd the m_plot is cleared to 0x0, because the parent aspect
    of a custompoint inside a Infoelement is not a CartesianPlot, but
    the InfoElement it self. Conflicts:
    src/backend/worksheet/WorksheetElement.cpp
  *  3e9ee3752 - [worksheet] use a more reasonable pen width to draw the
    hover/selection box.
  *  d317f934d - Don't react on selection changes in the project
    explorer on project load since this is leading to multiple changes
    in the properties explorer. We select the proper object at the very
    end after the project was completely loaded and show the
    corresponding properties widget only once.
  *  e84003be6 - [boxplot] save and load the min and max values of the
    box plot ranges. For other curves like xy-curve and histogram this
    is not needed since this values are determined in
    plot::retransform() directly from the data column. For  the box plot
    the logic is different and additional calculations are required to
    determin the ranges so we save it to properly show the box plot on
    project load.
  *  f9db34aa8 - Properly register signal-slot connections for newly
    added folders and all their children in MainWin.
  *  3f88a0f94 - [worksheet] removed redundant set-calls when change the
    background images files in the relevant classes.
  *  1f7c7e73c - [worksheet] moved the logic for the selection of the
    file for the backround image to a central place in GuiTools.
  *  dd0b2a330 - [worksheet] adjusted ImageElement to the new
    positionioning logic and create the image on the worksheet at the
    position where the context menu was called.
  *  07ae17127 - [boxplot] don't crash when the used data columns are
    deleted in the spreadsheet.
  *  5c811bcd0 - [spreadsheet] undo/redo for removing the heatmap
    formatting.
  *  b98a299f3 - [spreadsheet] undo/redo for setting the heatmap
    formatting.
  *  f98ad9f87 - [boxplot] position the middle of the box plot at the
    values 1, 2, 3, etc. instead of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc. and set the
    number of major axis  ticks to the number of data sets when creating
    box plots via the plot data dialog. This allows to place the major
    ticks below the box plot. The logic for auto ticks needs to be
    adjusted a bit now.

labplot (2.8.2+git8390-ef399fec2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Compile
  * URL: https://github.com/KDE/labplot.git
  * Branch: master
  * Commit: ef399fec2c77275947c331be121dbcd7a3e69f36
  * Date: 1620984775
  * git changelog:
  *  ef399fec2 - cmake: silent warning
  *  a5726bd25 - Allow to change the name and comment properties of
    Folder and Workbook in the properties explorer. Also, renamed Notes
    to Comment in the project properties widget to be consistent with
    the usage in other places.
  *  3d7267d9f - Fix build on Windows
  *  a707a6958 - readstat: Add tests
  *  e4b22c5e9 - cmake: output imorovements
  *  882e6fdda - readstat: clean up
  *  2167bb2a1 - readstat: Fix problem with value labels and clean up
  *  a1922692f - matio: minor fixes

  *  86f664bf7 - Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/KDE/labplot
  *  f0df9e73d - box plot: minor improvements
  *  43c584dba - [worksheet] always save the column path if available
    and not only when the column pointer is valid.  This is needed for
    the following workflows: plot data ->  delete one of the colums->
    save project and close it -> open it again and re-create the  column
    with the same name as used before. With this fix the column is
    properly restored in the plot.  This logic needs to be  implemented
    everywhere where WRITE_COLUMN is used right now.
  *  a6f95fb51 - Better wording for the import data related actions in
    the main window.
  *  3918819cf - [box plot] made BoxPlot inheriting from Curve to
    reimplement the hovering related functions. This fixes the problem
    with the proper hovering of xy-curves placed on top of a box plot.
    The hovering of box plot itself still needs to be fixed.
  *  a45abe3c4 - typo
  *  708392c58 - Minor fixes: 1. allow to copy&paste notes and
    datapicker objects 2. allow to paste folders on folders 3. activate
    the new project action after a project was openned 4. added dates to

    having a box plot.
  *  18e6ebafb - liborigin: add latest fixes from upstream
  *  f12f7b6af - liborigin: update build
  *  d8c92438f - [box plot] draw box plots in the legend (show the name
    only at the moment) and fixed the missing signal-slot connection for
    the boxplot visibility changes.
  *  9d9e155a9 - [import] fixed the invalid memory access in the origin
    parser.
  *  2e8921f83 - [worksheet] when mapping a point from logical to scene
    coordinates, check whether the mapped point is visible and react to
    this instead of comparing with QPointF(0,0). This removes artifacts
    like those arising during zooming in the box plot.
  *  e2235c653 - [worksheet] fixed the indentation in TextLabel.

    some values to have the textlabels again at the same position,
    because the handling is different in 2.9.0
  *  44231ca5f - use static function to access project version, because
    otherwise it is not possible to access from new created elements to
    the version number, because they don't have any Project object as
    Parent
  *  f63e2d0df - [box plot] allow to specify a factor in % to control
    the box width relativ to its default value.
  *  df693c0a5 - matio: import basic data types
  *  cb68e10b2 - Disable print, export and new project actions if a new
    and empty project was created.

  * Commit: 5d6cef45aa161e03b6c99db1d0d3f17f53739180
  * Date: 1619728405
  * git changelog:
  *  5d6cef45a - typo
  *  4aa156c06 - readstat: datetime value labels not supported
  *  fd86103d2 - [worksheet] allow to consume variables from CAS
    worksheets as custom columns in AxisDock (for custom tick positions
    and custom label values).
  *  1d359e410 - readstat: import value labels
  *  8efd27f6c - [spreadsheet] allow to specify labels for the values in
    a column. This initial implementation introduces the basic usage of
    this feature that will be made more complete in the later commits
    (undo/redo, save/load, better handling of DateTime values, batch
    edit mode, etc.)
  *  3b36a9fa3 - Fix crash in correlation and convolution & clean up
  *  c9a155efa - cmake: search for matio library
  *  a9e2b0b89 - axis: nice extend when zooming with mouse to avoid ugly
    ranges
  *  94ff93032 - axis: improve auto scientific tick label format
  *  3bb807922 - fixuifiles
  *  6db94e560 - [import] many online datasets are using quotes,
    especially R's datasets. Activate the option in ASCII filter to
    remove the quotes to properly import such data.
  *  fcc5e25f6 - [worksheet] better initial settings for the opacity in
    histograms and box plots.
  *  3052f0511 - [box plot] implemented notches.
  *  766e48160 - axis: Fix problems with values near zero and scientific
    format with precision zero
  *  cea7422d0 - [box plot] minor improvements.
  *  3a060a15c - [box plot] implemented jitters and far out values.
  *  e845e4021 - [worksheet] moved some common code from XYCurve and
    BoxPlot to CartesianCoordinateSystem.
  *  66525c993 - [worksheet] switched to using the new Symbol-classes
    also in the box plot. It's possible now to modify the symbol
    properties for mean, outlier, far out and jitter values in the box
    plot independent of each other.
  *  6cf5b990c - [worksheet] moved the settings for the custom label
    column from the tab Labels to the tab Ticks in the axis properties
    widget. Usually, when providing a custom column for the ticks
    position the user will also want to provide custom labels for them.
    So, it makes sense to keep these settings together in the same tab.
  *  0940d66a6 - [worksheet] properly handle the axis tick labels coming
    from a custom text column when the plot range is being changed
    during zooming etc.
  *  429f6523a - [worksheet] used the Symbol and SymbolWidget in the
    code for XYCurve and for Histogram.
  *  175f65093 - readstat: prepare reading value labels etc.
  *  de53420b7 - [worksheet] implemented the symbol specific logic in
    the class Symbol and introduced a new widget SymbolWidget to modify
    the properties of a symbol. This widget will be used everywhere
    where a symbol is available - xy-curve, histogram, custom point,
    boxplot (mean, outliers, jitters), and later probably more.
  *  426594747 - Fix crash when missing y scale due to range being zero
  *  90aa63cbe - [box plot] don't try to draw the symbol for the mean
    value if this point is outside of the currently visible plot region.
    Same for whisker caps. This now removes all ugly artefact in the box
    plot that could arise during zooming in the plot.
  *  3c1a421db - [box plot] properly clip the box of the boxplot on the
    plot boundaries when zooming in the plot.

    colors independent of the ColorMapsWidget.
  *  09ad50465 - Minor fixes.
  *  a0e369f16 - [worksheet] moved the check whether the multiple
    selected info elements have the same parent from GuiObserver into
    InfoElementDock.
  *  b9966f06f - Simplified the initialization of InfoElementDock in
    GuiObserver.
  *  67cbfa103 - [worksheet] suppress a couple of unneeded
    recalculations of the bounding rectangular in Histogram and in
    BoxPlot.
  *  8c275602c - Allow to paste Spreadsheet and Matrix into Workbook.
  *  512eb0196 - Allow to drop Spreadsheet and Matrix onto Workbook in

    histogram after this, the histogram should already get the second
    color from the palette.
  *  27c041510 - [histogram] implemented the normalization of the
    histogram. The normalization type Count is the usual normalization
    with the height of each bar being equal to the number of elements in

    applies for other curves like the histogram, too. So, the histogram
    is now also properly reacting of spreadsheet or workbook deletions.

    theme also for the lines of the different mouse cursor modes like
    zoom&select and crosshair to avoid situations where we're drawing

    via GuiTools, the items in the combobox get deleted first and the

  * Commit: 790960a8f9b336fad62a6e649e29a2c2d8a667b1
  * Date: 1597131691
  * git changelog:
  *  790960a8f - Removed the "show memory usage" from the settings
    dialog.
  *  d00c904ba - [worksheet] if we have double values for axis tick
    labels, we don't want to show them as integers, keep at least one
    float digit.

    (project and properties explorers).
  *  d43360756 - Fix attribute name
  *  fcf1787c2 - [worksheet] improved the calculation of the plot ranges
    with auto-scale option active: 1. don't take the size of the error
    bar caps into account, the current algorithm is not complete and
    it's ok if we ignore the caps and plot them on top of the axes. 2.
    when calculating mi and max values of a curve, ignore the values in
    the error columns if the error type is NoError.

    showing the content of the file can be expensive, show the wait
    cursor here. 2. clear the privous content of the model in
    JsonOptionsWidget when a new JSON file is loaded.
  *  f6819f91f - [json import] further fixes and optimizations: 1.
    create QJsonModel in JsonFilter when executing the tests since no
    model is available in this case. 2. use the already available full
    JSON document in the prepare step when the root element is selected,
    no need to re-create it again.
  *  95072f26d - minor fixes
  *  1df3dc04b - [json import] create the QJsonModel only once and use
    it in JsonFilter and in JsonOptionWidget to reduce the memory
    consumption.
