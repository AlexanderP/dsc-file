  *  8b9922f0f - fix element info custom point not visible. During

    src/backend/worksheet/WorksheetElement.cpp
  *  3e9ee3752 - [worksheet] use a more reasonable pen width to draw the
    hover/selection box.
  *  d317f934d - Don't react on selection changes in the project
    explorer on project load since this is leading to multiple changes
    in the properties explorer. We select the proper object at the very
    end after the project was completely loaded and show the
    corresponding properties widget only once.
  *  e84003be6 - [boxplot] save and load the min and max values of the
    box plot ranges. For other curves like xy-curve and histogram this
    is not needed since this values are determined in
    plot::retransform() directly from the data column. For  the box plot
    the logic is different and additional calculations are required to
    determin the ranges so we save it to properly show the box plot on
    project load.
  *  f9db34aa8 - Properly register signal-slot connections for newly
    added folders and all their children in MainWin.
  *  3f88a0f94 - [worksheet] removed redundant set-calls when change the
    background images files in the relevant classes.

    positionioning logic and create the image on the worksheet at the
    position where the context menu was called.

    deleted in the spreadsheet.
  *  5c811bcd0 - [spreadsheet] undo/redo for removing the heatmap
    formatting.
  *  b98a299f3 - [spreadsheet] undo/redo for setting the heatmap
    formatting.
  *  f98ad9f87 - [boxplot] position the middle of the box plot at the
    values 1, 2, 3, etc. instead of 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc. and set the
    number of major axis  ticks to the number of data sets when creating
    box plots via the plot data dialog. This allows to place the major
    ticks below the box plot. The logic for auto ticks needs to be
    adjusted a bit now.

    content in case the application settings were changed and the
    spreadsheet header needs to be adjusted according to the new
    settings (show column mode,  etc.).
  *  5cc2396dd - matio: read cell class type
  *  1d9f36982 - plot() is not yet assigned, when the axis was just
    added before. So use the parent element which is also the plot
  *  2d256c482 - if no coordinate system is available, it means no plot

  * Date: 1620984775
  * git changelog:
  *  ef399fec2 - cmake: silent warning
  *  a5726bd25 - Allow to change the name and comment properties of
    Folder and Workbook in the properties explorer. Also, renamed Notes
    to Comment in the project properties widget to be consistent with
    the usage in other places.
  *  3d7267d9f - Fix build on Windows
  *  a707a6958 - readstat: Add tests
  *  e4b22c5e9 - cmake: output imorovements

  *  86f664bf7 - Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/KDE/labplot
  *  f0df9e73d - box plot: minor improvements
  *  43c584dba - [worksheet] always save the column path if available
    and not only when the column pointer is valid.  This is needed for
    the following workflows: plot data ->  delete one of the colums->
    save project and close it -> open it again and re-create the  column
    with the same name as used before. With this fix the column is
    properly restored in the plot.  This logic needs to be  implemented
    everywhere where WRITE_COLUMN is used right now.
  *  a6f95fb51 - Better wording for the import data related actions in
    the main window.
  *  3918819cf - [box plot] made BoxPlot inheriting from Curve to
    reimplement the hovering related functions. This fixes the problem
    with the proper hovering of xy-curves placed on top of a box plot.
    The hovering of box plot itself still needs to be fixed.
  *  a45abe3c4 - typo
  *  708392c58 - Minor fixes: 1. allow to copy&paste notes and
    datapicker objects 2. allow to paste folders on folders 3. activate
    the new project action after a project was openned 4. added dates to

    having a box plot.
  *  18e6ebafb - liborigin: add latest fixes from upstream
  *  f12f7b6af - liborigin: update build
  *  d8c92438f - [box plot] draw box plots in the legend (show the name
    only at the moment) and fixed the missing signal-slot connection for
    the boxplot visibility changes.
  *  9d9e155a9 - [import] fixed the invalid memory access in the origin
    parser.
  *  2e8921f83 - [worksheet] when mapping a point from logical to scene
    coordinates, check whether the mapped point is visible and react to
    this instead of comparing with QPointF(0,0). This removes artifacts
    like those arising during zooming in the box plot.
  *  e2235c653 - [worksheet] fixed the indentation in TextLabel.

  *  d8a30def3 - If project version number is smaller than 2.9.0, Change
    some values to have the textlabels again at the same position,
    because the handling is different in 2.9.0
  *  44231ca5f - use static function to access project version, because
    otherwise it is not possible to access from new created elements to
    the version number, because they don't have any Project object as
    Parent
  *  f63e2d0df - [box plot] allow to specify a factor in % to control
    the box width relativ to its default value.
  *  df693c0a5 - matio: import basic data types
  *  cb68e10b2 - Disable print, export and new project actions if a new
    and empty project was created.

  * Commit: 5d6cef45aa161e03b6c99db1d0d3f17f53739180
  * Date: 1619728405
  * git changelog:
  *  5d6cef45a - typo
  *  4aa156c06 - readstat: datetime value labels not supported
  *  fd86103d2 - [worksheet] allow to consume variables from CAS
    worksheets as custom columns in AxisDock (for custom tick positions
    and custom label values).
  *  1d359e410 - readstat: import value labels
  *  8efd27f6c - [spreadsheet] allow to specify labels for the values in
    a column. This initial implementation introduces the basic usage of
    this feature that will be made more complete in the later commits
    (undo/redo, save/load, better handling of DateTime values, batch
    edit mode, etc.)
  *  3b36a9fa3 - Fix crash in correlation and convolution & clean up
  *  c9a155efa - cmake: search for matio library
  *  a9e2b0b89 - axis: nice extend when zooming with mouse to avoid ugly
    ranges
  *  94ff93032 - axis: improve auto scientific tick label format
  *  3bb807922 - fixuifiles
  *  6db94e560 - [import] many online datasets are using quotes,
    especially R's datasets. Activate the option in ASCII filter to
    remove the quotes to properly import such data.
  *  fcc5e25f6 - [worksheet] better initial settings for the opacity in
    histograms and box plots.
  *  3052f0511 - [box plot] implemented notches.
  *  766e48160 - axis: Fix problems with values near zero and scientific
    format with precision zero
  *  cea7422d0 - [box plot] minor improvements.
  *  3a060a15c - [box plot] implemented jitters and far out values.
  *  e845e4021 - [worksheet] moved some common code from XYCurve and
    BoxPlot to CartesianCoordinateSystem.
  *  66525c993 - [worksheet] switched to using the new Symbol-classes
    also in the box plot. It's possible now to modify the symbol
    properties for mean, outlier, far out and jitter values in the box
    plot independent of each other.
  *  6cf5b990c - [worksheet] moved the settings for the custom label
    column from the tab Labels to the tab Ticks in the axis properties
    widget. Usually, when providing a custom column for the ticks
    position the user will also want to provide custom labels for them.
    So, it makes sense to keep these settings together in the same tab.
  *  0940d66a6 - [worksheet] properly handle the axis tick labels coming
    from a custom text column when the plot range is being changed
    during zooming etc.
  *  429f6523a - [worksheet] used the Symbol and SymbolWidget in the
    code for XYCurve and for Histogram.
  *  175f65093 - readstat: prepare reading value labels etc.
  *  de53420b7 - [worksheet] implemented the symbol specific logic in
    the class Symbol and introduced a new widget SymbolWidget to modify
    the properties of a symbol. This widget will be used everywhere
    where a symbol is available - xy-curve, histogram, custom point,
    boxplot (mean, outliers, jitters), and later probably more.
  *  426594747 - Fix crash when missing y scale due to range being zero
  *  90aa63cbe - [box plot] don't try to draw the symbol for the mean
    value if this point is outside of the currently visible plot region.
    Same for whisker caps. This now removes all ugly artefact in the box
    plot that could arise during zooming in the plot.
  *  3c1a421db - [box plot] properly clip the box of the boxplot on the
    plot boundaries when zooming in the plot.

    recalculations of the bounding rectangular in Histogram and in
    BoxPlot.
  *  8c275602c - Allow to paste Spreadsheet and Matrix into Workbook.
  *  512eb0196 - Allow to drop Spreadsheet and Matrix onto Workbook in
    the project explorer and also expand the destination object after
    the drop was finalized so the dropped object is automatically
    visible.

  *  e2d6349be - [spreadsheet] show the pdf-normalized histogram in the
    KDE plot in the column statistics dialog.
  *  896d7f88b - [histogram] count density and probability density
    normalizations.
  *  661c77ce1 - [worksheet] extended the logic in previous commit also
    to BoxPlots.
  *  bece2e8a0 - [worksheet] when adding new curve like objects to the
    plot (xy-curve, histogram, etc.) and assigning the color index from
    the current theme, determine the index for children of all types and
    not within one type only. I.e., if a xy-curve was added and a
    histogram after this, the histogram should already get the second
    color from the palette.
  *  27c041510 - [histogram] implemented the normalization of the
    histogram. The normalization type Count is the usual normalization
    with the height of each bar being equal to the number of elements in
    the bin. The normalization type Probability normalizes the height by
    the total number of elements in all bins (the area below the
    histogram envelope is equal to 1). Other normalizations will be
    implemented later.
  *  da416ac08 - [worksheet] use Text instead of Text Label in the
    context menu of the plot to be consisted with the wording used in

    positioning was possible via coordinates for axis title label.
  *  1d3f2b0bd - GIT_SILENT changelog
  *  8e6b2b018 - Worksheet export to more image formats
  *  3c32aa99f - First version of the Color Maps Browser. This dialog
    will be used later to select a color map for different purposes in
    the application like for the conditional formatting in the
    spreadsheet, for heatmaps, etc. In the initial version all color
    maps from the CollowBrewer collection are included.

    theme also for the lines of the different mouse cursor modes like
    zoom&select and crosshair to avoid situations where we're drawing

    custom point (last possible enum value was missed).

    InfoElement's label when curves are added/removed and use the proper

  *  fcf1787c2 - [worksheet] improved the calculation of the plot ranges
    with auto-scale option active: 1. don't take the size of the error
    bar caps into account, the current algorithm is not complete and
    it's ok if we ignore the caps and plot them on top of the axes. 2.
    when calculating mi and max values of a curve, ignore the values in
    the error columns if the error type is NoError.

    cursor here. 2. clear the privous content of the model in
    JsonOptionsWidget when a new JSON file is loaded.
  *  f6819f91f - [json import] further fixes and optimizations: 1.
    create QJsonModel in JsonFilter when executing the tests since no
    model is available in this case. 2. use the already available full
    JSON document in the prepare step when the root element is selected,
    no need to re-create it again.
  *  95072f26d - minor fixes
