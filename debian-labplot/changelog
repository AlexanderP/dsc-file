  *  eee041498 - In the previous commit a signal was removed in
    ProjectExplorer::load() to avoid calling the update of windows
    visibility multiple times in MainWin. This caused a regression with
    the views not being shown after the project load. To address both

    only once after the project was loaded.

  *  77a95ebba - GIT_SILENT Minor changes
  *  791eb64b5 - When loading the project, handle the current aspect

    function
  *  f549042fe - [spreadsheet] when loading columns, don't call the
    setters for the numeric formats and digits if the saved values are

    during the project load.
  *  4879c2d10 - In the event filter in ProjectExplorer only react on
    mouse events in the tree view to avoid wrong casts. The issue is
    reported by UBSAN.
  *  c745baf3e - When populating a comboboxe with pen and brush styles
    via GuiTools, the items in the combobox get deleted first and the
    current index is -1. Don't react on -1 in the corresponding slots
    otherwise we convert -1 to Qt::PenStyle or Qt::BrushStyle which is

    the curves are not shown.
