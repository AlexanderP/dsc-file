clementine for Debian
=====================

The current original upstream version of clementine use some embedded copy code located in 3rdparty/*. 

Some of them can be replaced by an equivalent Debian package
------------------------------------------------------------

* libprojectm2: It is a shared library already packaged in Debian but some patches are
needed to compile Clementine with it. Patches are now included since version 2.0.1+dfsg-6
of libprojectm2. (see #600653)

* libqxt: It is a shared library just packaged in Debian.

* taglib: It is a shared library packaged in Debian.

Some of them must be used in this package
-----------------------------------------

* qsqlite: It is a shared library also packaged in Debian (libqt4-sql-sqlite)
  but not usable for the reasons above.
  There is a dispute around sqlite usage in clementine and Debian DFSG rules.
  Note that in previous version, clementine developers recommended to use an
  embedded version of the entire sqlite3 library which was not acceptable in
  Debian. So we always remove the embedded copy and force the use of the system
  version of sqlite by set the cmake options. Past stories here:
    - http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=722471
    - http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/issues/detail?id=3865
    - http://code.google.com/p/clementine-player/issues/detail?id=3847
  Now clementine developers no longer use/include an embedded version of
  sqlite3 which is a good point. However they now stricly require to use a
  embedded version of the Qt4 sqlite plugin which include specific changes for
  clementine. The explanation is at line 318 of CMakeList.txt file.

* qtsingleapplication: It is a small shared library not packaged in Debian 
unfortunately. It is used by others Debian package as embed code copy too.

* qtiocompressor: It is a small shared library not packaged in Debian unfortunately.

* sha2: It is a small shared library not packaged in Debian unfortunately.

* qocoa: It is a collection of Qt wrappers. It is used for easily switch between standard Qt widget
and OSX widget according to the platform. It is a hard requirement for Clementine.
Upstream author recommends to use it as an embed copy :
  - https://github.com/mikemcquaid/Qocoa#usage

* libmygpo-qt: It is a small shared library not packaged in Debian unfortunately.
In addition, Clementine upstream developers want to use their own embed version
for the moment. (see CMakeLists.txt)

* gmock: It is a test framework. There are a package google-mock inÂ Debian but
  it does not provide any shared libraries and recommends to use gmock
  framework staticaly like clementine developers does. See README.Debian file
  of google-mock package.

Some of them must not be used in this package
---------------------------------------------

* qtwin: Not needed on GNU/Linux system so not used in this package.

* tinysvcmdns: Not needed on GNU/Linux system so not used in this package.

* fancytabwidget: Only useful for certain experimental options.

* SPMediaKeyTap: Not needed on GNU/Linux system so not used in this package.

* google-brakepad: Only useful for reporting bugs using the google-breakpad service
  not needed in Debian.

* vreen: Only useful to enable the optional VK module. No Debian package available.

"Easter eggs"
-------------

The current upstream version of clementine also use some non-dfsg files located in data/.
They are mainly used for some "Easter eggs" displayed in clementine interface.

For the reasons above, the following components have been removed in the DFSG Debian version of this package :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
* 3rdparty/fancytabwidget
* 3rdparty/libprojectm
* 3rdparty/qtwin
* 3rdparty/vreen
* 3rdparty/taglib
* 3rdparty/qxt
* data/lumberjacksong.txt
* data/hypnotoad.gif
* 3rdparty/google-breakpad
* 3rdparty/SPMediaKeyTap
* mingw/
* 3rdparty/tinysvcmdns/
