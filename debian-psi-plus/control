Description: Qt-based XMPP client (basic version)
 This package contains basic version of Psi+. Use it if you prefer old
 fashioned plain text chats from era of IRC heyday.
 .
 Psi is a cross-platform powerful XMPP client designed for experienced users.
 User interface of program is very flexible in customization. For example,
 there are "multi windows" and "all in one" modes, support of different
 iconsets and themes. Psi supports file sharing and audio/video calls. Security
 is also a major consideration, and Psi provides it for both client-to-server
 (TLS) and client-to-client (OpenPGP, OTR, OMEMO) via appropriate plugins.
 .
 Psi+ is a development branch of Psi with rolling release development model.
 Users who wants to receive new features and bug fixes very quickly may use
 Psi+ on daily basis. Users who do not care about new trends and prefer
 constancy may choose Psi as it uses classical development model and its
 releases are quite rare.
