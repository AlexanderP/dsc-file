gme/Game_Music_Emu-0.5.2/*: Game Music Emulators
    Copyright (c) 2003-2006 Shay Green <gblargg@gmail.com>
    Licensed under LGPL license.

dumb/*: DUMB - Dynamic Universal Music Bibliotheque
    Copyright (c) 2001-2005 Ben Davis, Robert J Ohannessian and Julien Cugniere.

    License:

    This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
    In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the
    use of this software.

    Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
    including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
    freely, subject to the following restrictions:

    1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim
       that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a
       product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product
       documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of
       this software, but this is not a strict requirement.

       [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.
       Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".]

       [The only reason why the link is not strictly required is that such a
       requirement prevents DUMB from being used in projects with certain other
       licences, notably the GPL. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html .]

    2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
       misrepresented as being the original software.

    3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.

    4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom at any Monday
       3:05 PM, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
       clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
       clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]

    [Note: clause 4 was resigned after a quick IRC talk with the author]

    [Note 2: if I did not mention /usr/share/common-licenses here, lintian
             would complain because he found the words "GPL" above, but this
             software is not GPL. It is GPL-compatible, though.]
