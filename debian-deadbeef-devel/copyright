License:
 This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.
 In no event shall the authors be held liable for any damages arising from the
 use of this software.
 .
 Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
 including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
 freely, subject to the following restrictions:
 .
 1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not claim
    that you wrote the original software. If you use this software in a
    product, you are requested to acknowledge its use in the product
    documentation, along with details on where to get an unmodified version of
    this software, but this is not a strict requirement.
 .
    [Note that the above point asks for a link to DUMB, not just a mention.
    Googling for DUMB doesn't help much! The URL is "http://dumb.sf.net/".] 
 .
    [The only reason why the link is not strictly required is that such a
    requirement prevents DUMB from being used in projects with certain other
    licences, notably the GPL. See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html .] 
 .
 2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
    misrepresented as being the original software.
 .
 3. This notice may not be removed from or altered in any source distribution.
 .
 4. If you are using the Program in someone else's bedroom at any Monday
    3:05 PM, you are not allowed to modify the Program for ten minutes. [This
    clause provided by Inphernic; every licence should contain at least one
    clause, the reasoning behind which is far from obvious.]
 .
 [Note: clause 4 was resigned after a quick IRC talk with the author]
 .
 [Note 2: if I did not mention /usr/share/common-licenses here, lintian
 		 would complain because he found the words "GPL" above, but this
 		 software is not GPL. It is GPL-compatible, though.]
