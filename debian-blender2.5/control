Description: Very fast and versatile 3D modeller/renderer
 Blender is an integrated 3d suite for modelling, animation, rendering, 
 post-production, interactive creation and playback (games). Blender has 
 its own particular user interface, which is implemented entirely in 
 OpenGL and designed with speed in mind. Python bindings are available 
 for scripting; import/export features for popular file formats like 3D 
 Studio and Wavefront Obj are implemented as scripts by the community. 
 Stills, animations, models for games or other third party engines and 
 interactive content in the form of a standalone binary and/or a web 
 plug-in are common products of Blender use.
