Description: CD/DVD quality checker
 QPxTool gives you access to all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written

 increase the chance for a long data lifetime.

 QPxTool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the Q-Checks
 and not all of them are supported by QPxTool. Currently, most newer drives of
