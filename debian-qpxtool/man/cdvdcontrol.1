AutoStrategy (AS) is a Feature to determine a writing strategy for an inserted empty DVD media. Writing strategies are saved in the AutoStrategy DataBase (ASDB). This command needs a specified \fBDEVICE\fR.

.B \-\-as-mode 
.I mode
.br

.br 			
			new one is created.
.br 
\fB	forced\fR	creates a new ASDB entry, even if there is already 
.br
 			one available in the ASDB.
.br 
\fB	on\fR		an existing AS from the DB is used. If there is no 
 			entry, the strategy from the firmware is used.
