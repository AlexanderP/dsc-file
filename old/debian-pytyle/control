Description: Manual tiling manager for EWMH compliant window managers
 PyTyle is an extremely versatile and extensible tiling manager that is meant
 to be embedded into EWMH window managers. Its feature set was modeled after
 the basic tiling features of XMonad- even down to the key bindings.
 .
 It has been tested relatively well on OpenBox and partially on Fluxbox. It
 should, in theory, work with any window manager complying with the EWMH
 standards.
