launchy for Debian
------------------

Upstream tarball has been repackaged to remove included .dll and .exe files
without sources.

Sources include a couple of .doc files: "Readme.doc" and 
"Plugin API/PluginPage.doc", which are the source of the corresponding:
"Readme.pdf" and "Plugin API/api.html".
