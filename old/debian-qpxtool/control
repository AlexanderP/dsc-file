Description: CD/DVD quality checker
 QPxTool gives you access to all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written

 the right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which will
 increase the chance for a long data lifetime.

 QPxTool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the Q-Checks
 and not all of them are supported by QPxTool. Currently, most newer drives of
 LiteOn, NEC, Pioneer and Plextor are supported.
