.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
jbig2 \-b newdoc \-s \-p image1.jpg image2.jpg ...
.sp
jbig2pdf newdoc > newdoc.pdf
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBjbig2pdf\fP creates a PDF document from \fBjbig2\fP\(aqs PDF\-ready output
(created using \fI\-s\fP and \fI\-p\fP, \fI\-\-pdf\fP).
.sp
\fBjbig2pdf\fP takes only one argument: the base name of the files created
by \fBjbig2\fP, which is set with \fBjbig2\fP\(aqs \fI\-b\fP option.  Without \fI\-b\fP,
the default name is \fBoutput\fP\&.
.sp
The PDF is written to standard output, which normally should be redirected
to a file (see the example above).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
\fBjbig2pdf\fP exits with 0 (success) status if the conversion completed
OK, and non\-zero status if anything went wrong. If standard output was
redirected to a file, the file will be empty or invalid when non\-zero
status is returned. Diagnostic messages are printed to standard error.
