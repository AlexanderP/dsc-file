Description: KDE-based next generation IRC client with module support
 A highly configurable graphical IRC client with an MDI interface,
 built-in scripting language, support for IRC DCC, drag & drop file
 browsing, and much more. KVIrc uses the KDE widget set, can be extended
 using its own scripting language, integrates with KDE, and supports
 custom plugins.

 wrong choice as it is rather big. But if you want a highly customizable client
 you won't regret the installation.
