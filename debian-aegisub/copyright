 Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
 General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
 permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate with
 Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h, regardless
 of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
 the resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
 every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
 the source code of Avisynth (the version of Avisynth used to produce the
 combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU General
 Public License plus this exception. An independent module is a module
 which is not derived from or based on Avisynth, such as 3rd-party filters,
 import and export plugins, or graphical user interfaces.
