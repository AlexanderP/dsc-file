    Linking Avisynth statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
    combined work based on Avisynth.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
    General Public License cover the whole combination.
    .
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of Avisynth give you
    permission to link Avisynth with independent modules that communicate with
    Avisynth solely through the interfaces defined in avisynth.h, regardless of the license
    terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the
    resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that
    every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete copy of
    the source code of Avisynth (the version of Avisynth used to produce the
    combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU General
    Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a module
    which is not derived from or based on Avisynth, such as 3rd-party filters,
    import and export plugins, or graphical user interfaces.
